Cards, for obvious reasons.  Each one lets you perform an action
in battle. The pictures on the cards
should give you a general idea.", 
TN_YellowArea_Painky01_01_07,"For example, look at this one.
It has two boots on it.  That means this card will let you
use a Jump attack two times.

shows the number of attacks.",

one super-powerful Jump attack.  The bigger the icon, the stronger 
the attack. Simple, right?",

this spot.",

TN_YellowArea_Painky01_10_01,"Next, you can add paint to the card
you've selected. Just touch the card

TN_YellowArea_Painky11_2,"All right, now you might not like this
part as much. They're gonna attack
you!  But you don't have to just sit there
and take it, Mario. You can defend
yourself! It's the law!  Press  right before an enemy
attacks you to block some of the
damage.", 
TN_YellowArea_Painky01_21_01,"Yesss!",

You're a natural, kid.",

shape than I thought.  But no worries—he just needs a fresh
coat of paint, and he'll be as good
as new.", 
TN_YellowArea_Peach02,"Really?
You can revive him with paint?
That would be a miracle!  He...̠won't come back as some
kind of freaky zombie Toad,̠ right?", 
TN_YellowArea_Painky02_02,"No, ma'am—he'll be the same Toad
he's always been. That's the power
of paint!", 
TN_YellowArea_Painky02_03,"You see...paint isn't just for
powering up Battle Cards...  Paint adds beauty and life to the
world!  So I've taken the liberty of loading
up your hammer with all the

recognize you.", 
TN_YellowArea_Painky03,"See? That's the power of paint!  Now, I've got to warn you.
I gave you everything I've got,
but it won't last forever.  If you want to keep on painting the
world around you, you're going to
have to resupply from time to time.", 
TN_YellowArea_Kinopio04,"So, this can here just saved my life?
̠I knew all that recycling would pay
off one day!  Hey, just in case we get ambushed
by any more freaks with bendy
straws...  Where exactly are we supposed to
find this magical life-giving paint
you speak of?", 
TN_YellowArea_Painky04,"Easy. Remember that fountain in
the center of town? You know, the
one where I was taking a nap?  Well, it's the prime source of paint
for ALL of Prism Island!  We've got six Big Paint Stars hooked
up to the thing, and they'll put out
as much paint as you like.  Plus, I mean...paint pretty much flies
out of everything around here.  Try hitting stuff with your hammer.
You'll see what I mean.", 
TN_YellowArea_Peach21,"Oh, that's wonderful news.  I was a little worried, because the
fountain looked completely dry
when we woke you up.", 
TN_YellowArea_Kinopio05,"Yeah! So, I guess we just needed to
turn it on or something, right? It was
definitely dry when we got there.", 
TN_YellowArea_Painky05,"Bahaha! Dry?! Good one, Toad!
Mario, you might wanna give this
guy another whack with that
hammer.  I mean...Ĭdry?! Please.̠
Our Big Paint Stars could never run
dry. C'mon, I'll show you.", 
TN_YellowArea_Kinopio06,"Paint Stars? I don't know what a
Paint Star is, but I definitely didn't
see anything like that.", 
TN_YellowArea_Peach23,"Mario! There's another colorless
figure over there!  We can't just leave him like that...
What should we do?", 
TN_aTalk_Peach3,"We've got to help that poor colorless
soul, Mario!", 
TN_aTalk_Kinopio2,"Thank you, Mario. I knew we could
count on you!", 
TN_YellowArea_Peach24,"You're just going to abandon that
poor colorless soul over there?

surrounded by a bunch of thirsty
Shy Guys...",

Shy Guys who stole my cards,
turn 'em into scrap paper!", 
TN_YellowArea_Kinopio07,"Hey, Mario! Nice work with those
Battle Cards!  I gotta say, though—your Action

press  to throw it!  If you press  too early or too late,
it'll fizzle into a tiny failball and the
attack will end prematurely.  But if you keep pressing  at the
