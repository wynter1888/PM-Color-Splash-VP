RB_BridgeBreak_Painky07,"Something tells me he's heard of
you before...   This Morton guy is going to be
trouble. Let's tread carefully.", 
RB_TowerGate_Painky01,"Mario! Look at this gate!", 
RB_TowerGate_Painky02,"Is it just me, or do these kind of look
like weird mushroom-shaped
keyholes?  Maybe the gate will open if we find
those three keys?",

I have to get back to Port Prisma!  Just you wait, bridge! I'll fix you up
