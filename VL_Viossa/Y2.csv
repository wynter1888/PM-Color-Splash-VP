 IT'S WORSE THAN I EVER COULD
 HAVE IMAGINED!", 
Y2_PitFall_Painky02,"Mario! Are you OK?
You can't touch the black paint!", 
Y2_PitFall_Painky03,"I'm sorry... I should have warned you.  I need to make this right...", 
Y2_PitFall_Painky04,"OK. You can open your eyes now.", 
Y2_PitFall_Painky05,"All right! Now let's never speak
of this again!", 
Y2_PitFall_Painky06,"Look, there's the Mini Paint Star I
must have originally smelled.
Onward!", 
Y2_HammerUp_KUR01,"You want some of this, pretty boy?
I'll slap that mustache off your face!", 
Y2_GiantGate_Rescue01,"Welcome to the Scarlet Gate, Mario.
Though it's not so scarlet anymore...", 
Y2_GiantGate_Rescue02,"No, I'm afraid that its bold red color
has been drained. ĬAlso, it's locked.  What am I supposed to call it now?
The Plain Gate? The Vanilla Gate?  Just adding ""gate"" to another
word seems kind of dumb.", 
Y2_GiantGate_Rescue03,"Yeah, but that's a big paint job!
I don't even think my whole squad
could get it done.", 
Y2_PitFall_Painky03_2,"Would you, ̠uh, ̠mind closing your
eyes for a sec?", 
Y2_GiantGate_Painky01,"I'm guessing it won't open until we
repaint it.", 
Y2_GiantGate_Painky02,"This really is a big paint job.
There's no way we can do it alone.  Let's just focus on finding more Paint
Stars. We can deal with this later.", 
Y2_GiantGate_Painky03,"We'll never be able to paint this
ourselves. Let's just get out of here.", 
Y2_GiantGate_Painky04,"Look at that, Mario! You see what
I mean by the power of paint?  The Big Paint Star did all of this
by itself. Now the Scarlet Gate
is as good as new!", 
Y2_GiantGate_Painky05,"All right, we're in!  I smell another Paint Star around
here somewhere—let's go find it!", 
Y2_PitFall_Painky01_2,"Everything has been painted black!  That thing that fell from the sky
must have been a...̠a bomb full of
black paint!  I've got a REALLY bad feeling about
this...", 
Y2_GiantGate_Rescue03_2,"My squad! I'm late!
The squad leader's gonna
shish-kebab me!", 
Y2_FallTree_Painky01_2,"I've got a really bad feeling about
this, Mario.  The last time I felt this way, I caught
someone mixing eggshell and flat
paints! Do you realize how—", 
Y2_LogFactory_KNP03_1,"Our saw mill was attacked!
Those guys better not have rolled
our logs around or had ANY fun with
them AT ALL!", 
Y2_LogFactory_KNP03_2,"The logs we make here are really
important. They make pencils
out of them and stuff!", 
Y2_GiantGate_Painky02_1,"No, seriously, you're never going to
paint this whole thing yourself.
You're wasting your time!", 
Y2_FallTree_KNP01,"Oh, thank you for rescuing me from
that tree. And repainting me, too!  Those slurping lunatics chased me
up this tree and then drained all my
color.  They've ruined trees for me forever!", 
Y2_FallTree_KNP02,"Ugh, I just came out here for a
picnic, and look what happened!", 
Y2_LogFactory_KNP01,"Mario! I was running for my life
when they drained my color!  Thanks for saving me.
I'm going to continue running
for my life now.   ÈAHHHHHH! d", 
Y2_HammerUp_Painky01,"Mario, your preemptive hammer and
jump strikes will grow more powerful
every time you find a Big Paint Star.  If an enemy is weak enough, you
might be able to just instantly
squash 'em with your hammer
and not have to battle at all!", 
Y2_FallTree_KNP02_2,"*sigh* I miss the days of plentiful
paint, when we could even BATHE
in paint if we wanted.  Please, Mario...find our precious
Paint Stars as soon as possible!", 
Y2_PitFall_Painky02_2,"This stuff is beyond toxic!
Whatever you do, don't touch it!", 
Y2_LogSignboard_01,"Try hitting the log with
the Unfurl Hammer.", 
Y2_LogSignboard_02,"Try hitting this log with
the Unfurl Hammer too.", 
Y2_LogSignboard_03,"Try hitting this with
the Unfurl Hammer.", 
Y2_LogFactory_Painky01,"Man! What's with this place? First
the stinky paint, now a faulty ramp?  What's next? Improper soil slopes?", 
Y2_LogFactory_Painky02,"*sniff* *sniff*   UGH! Something smells TERRIBLE
around here! Like paint mixed
with...̠stinkier paint...̠or something.", 
Y2_LogFactory_Painky03,"It's coming from over there
somewhere. Let's go check
it out.", 
Y2_FallTree_Painky01,"You know, it's awfully quiet around
here. That's never good.", 
Y2_FallTree_Painky02,"  Did you see that?!   Some kind of missile just landed
in those faraway hills!  Step on it, Mario!", 
Y2_LogFactory_KNP02_1,"While I was lying there color-drained,
I had the most terrible nightmare!  I dreamed that this bad guy named
Wart took over our log factory!
Was the whole thing really a dream?", 
Y2_LogFactory_KNP02_2,"I can't shake the feeling that it
wasn't just a bad dream...",
