stole that bone right out from under
our noses! Sorry...someone OTHER
than Mario, I meant.", 
O1_BreakBridgeKinopioPhase3_01,"Wait a minute... This area isn't
supposed to be seismically active.
Why are we getting earthquakes?  No...a localized quake of that size
could only be caused by...some sort
of giant creature!",

the time I ran out of snacks...̠
Oh, and was buried alive.",

What happened here?!",

think of the scaffolding?",

would you?", 
O1_EntranceKinopioPhase1_01,"I believe we've made an important
discovery!  Now, we have to be super careful
when we excavate it. Just like the
professor said.",

O1_Run_Painky01,"This whole dig site seems a bit...̠
seismoǴloǴlogically unstable, wouldn't
you say?   And I just felt a little vibration
in the air...", 
O1_Run_Painky02,"Oh, hey! I found a safe spot over
here for you. I was just keeping
it warm.", 
O1_CheckerKinopioPhase7_01,"I can't believe it! The fossil is
just...gone!", 
O1_Run_Painky03,"Anyway, what WAS that thing?
It's probably been causing all
of the problems around here.  Let's head back to the main
site before it comes back.", 
O1_3FRightKinopioPhase4_01,"Oh no!", 
O1_CheckerKinopioPhase2_Painky01,"Yes! Now we can see what all the
fuss is about.  Oh, right...I suppose we should also
be looking for Paint Stars...  How about this? You keep looking
for Paint Stars, and I'll just do a
tiny amount of fossil hunting. Deal?", 
O1_CheckerKinopioPhase2_Painky02,"Ah! We have a permit! See, check
it out!", 
O1_CheckerKinopioPhase2_00,"Hold on! You need a permit from
the professor to access this area.",

show her age. But, then again,
so am I...",

anything, or even look at anything
too hard. But above all...have fun!", 
O1_TailKinopioPhase7_01,"Man, that thing was HUGE!
I thought the breeze from its wings
flapping was gonna blow me away!", 
O1_CheckerKinopioPhase2_02,"To access the dig site, please use
the scaffolding.  And watch where you step! We've
had a number of small earthquakes
recently.", 
O1_3FLeftKinopioPhase4_01,"Eyahh!", 
O1_CheckerKinopioPhase2_03,"I'm sorry, but do you have a permit
to access this area?  See, we've discovered an extremely
rare fossil, and we must take special
care to preserve it.  We can't have just anyone stomping
around all over the place!  If you REALLY need to get in here,
you'll need to speak to the professor.
Good day.",

Star came flying out and sprayed
paint everywhere, which turned the
bones into some kind of dinosaur!  Wait...did that really happen, or
am I hallucinating? Is any of this
even real?", 
O1_TailKinopioPhase2_02,"Hey, buddy!
Are you TRYING to cause a rockslide?",

down in a site like this, you just run,
man.  I didn't even know what I was
running from!", 
O1_EntranceKinopio2Phase7_01,"Aw man! I came all the way here to
see the big fossil, and now it's gone!  Where did it go, anyway? It's not
like it could have grown wings and
flown away, right? Haha!", 
O1_Shake_Painky01,"Whoa, did you feel that?", 
O1_Shake_Painky02,"It's getting louder! What's going on?!", 
O1_EntranceKinopioPhase3_01,"That was quite a rumble! And now
I hear a bunch of shouting coming
from the dig site. What's going on?!", 
O1_BuryKinopio_Painky01,"Well, I'm not sure how it'll help us,
but let's give that bone a squeeze!
You know, for science.", 
O1_3FRightKinopioPhase3_01,"There's a Toad buried alive directly
above us!  I know", "buried alive"" sounds pretty
bad, but the", "alive"" part is good,
at least. ǴAnyway...hurry!", 
O1_BuryKinopio_Painky02,"Mario, we've already come all 
this way. Might as well wring out
that bone.",

There's a Toad trapped in there!  He's still alive, but he's running
dangerously low on snacks!", 
O1_EntranceKinopio2Phase5_01,"I guess we're all done here...  It's a little disappointing for things
to end like that after all the
painstaking work we did...", 
O1_TopKinopioPhase3_02,"The way you broke him out without
damaging any fossils—that's some
good hammer work, Mario!  We could really use someone like
you full-time at this dig.", 
O1_EngineerKinopioPhase1_01,"Oh, hello, Mario!  I don't suppose you've heard the
news. My beloved engine here is
scheduled to be decommissioned.  I'm sad she's being put out to
pasture, but we all get old
eventually, don't we?", 
O1_3FLeftKinopioPhase3_01,"Somebody help!  The vibrations triggered a cave-in,
and one of our excavators is
trapped!", 
O1_EntranceKinopioPhase7_01,"Mario, you're not gonna believe this!
The Draggadon fossil came to life
and flew away!  I'm no professor, but I didn't think
fossils could do that! Maybe you
should talk to the actual professor
about this...", 
O1_3FBeroKinopioPhase3,"The scaffolding is broken... You're
going to have to take the long
way to the top, guys.  Head for the spot where the wall
caved in. Good luck!", 
O1_FootholdKinopioPhase6_Painky01,"Oh man! We worked so hard to
find that thing.  Any idea who might have nabbed
it? Can we get one of the Rescue
Squads working on rescuing it?  I'm just thinking out loud
here, people!", 
O1_FanKinopioPhase1_01,"Isn't this a cool old-fashioned train?!
I could stare at it all day long...  Us train fanatics are called", "railfans.""
I'll wait for hours just catch a glimpse
of a passing train!  This train is bound for Kiwano
Temple. I'm gonna follow it, but first
I need to find some place to cry
about my life for a while.", 
O1_3FCenterKinopioPhase3_01,"This is a soft-hat zone, guys. Make
sure you're wearing a soft, poofy
hat at all times!", 
O1_3FCenterKinopioPhase3_02,"Hey, don't scare me like that!
I thought it was another rockslide!",

O1_BuryKinopioPhase3_02,"Help!", 
O1_BuryKinopioPhase3_03,"Whoa, it's bright out here!", 
O1_TopKinopioPhase7_01,"I didn't think anything could be
more impressive than the fossil
itself. ʼI was wrong.", 
O1_EntranceKinopioPhase2_01,"I'm no professor, but if you ask me,
that's a Draggadon skeleton!  Please be careful to avoid touching
it! Even the slightest brush of your
hand could destroy it.  And I'd hate to think of what a
hammer strike could do...", 
O1_BuryKinopioPhase3_04,"Five more minutes and I would've
been gnawing on this thing...", 
O1_BuryKinopioPhase3_05,"You know...I still kind of want to
sink my teeth into that thing.", 
O1_FootholdKinopioPhase5_01,"A bunch of the scaffolding was
destroyed in the incident.  We've got some new stuff up, but
it's not quite as...Ĭum...Ĭdirect.
So...Ĭgood luck with that.", 
O1_3FRightKinopioPhase5_01,"That fossil sure is bright and white.
Seems like it should be dirtier after
being buried for 500 million years...  Heck, my socks are dirtier than
that thing, and I've only been
wearing them for two weeks!", 
O1_3FLeftBeroKinopioPhase3_01,"Mario! We need your help! This
place is a disaster zone after
that big earthquake.", 
O1_3FLeftBeroKinopioPhase3_02,"That earthquake really shook things
up around here! Like...Ǵsomething
that shakes really hard. I'm too
shaken to think of a good analogy...",

Toad who got caved in? ǴGood luck!",

ever seen.",

We're gonna be famous! We're
gonna be rich!  We're gonna sell the movie rights!", 
O1_BuryKinopioPhase4_Painky01,"So this is a Draggadon fossil?
I wouldn't want to run into this
guy in a dark alley!  I didn't expect it to be so...colorless.
Kind of looks like it's been drained!", 
O1_BuryKinopioPhase4_Painky02,"Hey, Mario. Smells like there's a
Paint Star on the other side of that
hole. Let's check it out.", 
O1_CheckerKinopioPhase1_01,"Sorry, this area is off limits right
now. Unless you have a permit.  See, we found an extremely rare
fossil, and we can't have just
anyone walking around.  If you don't know what you're doing,
you could stomp on a million-year-old
bone or something!  Anyway, if you REALLY need access,
see the professor. He's currently
working at Château Chanterelle.",

without a permit.  If you want a permit, you'll have to
talk to the professor.  If you want to see the professor,

Chanterelle.  If you want a hug, I'm your Toad.", 
O1_3FCenterKinopioPhase5_01,"I don't know what to do with myself
now that the digging is all done.  Maybe I'll excavate my backyard
this weekend...", 
O1_BuryKinopioPhase5_01,"Um, guys? You might want to take
a look in this room over here...", 
O1_RailEnd_Painky01,"The tracks just stretch off into the
vast, boring unknown here, Mario.
No point going this way.",

through here and off into the
sunset...",

I'm glad someone finally put those
fossil robbers in their place!", 
GoalMap_Penky02,"Well, it's been real, but let's grab
the Paint Star and get outta here!",

it makes me want it even more!  C'mon. Let's go ask this", "professor"" if
we can poke around his dig site.",

this wall and ran off into the sunset.",

it makes me want it even more!  Plus, I KNOW I can smell a Paint
Star in there somewhere...  C'mon. Let's go ask this", "professor"" if
we can poke around his dig site.",

Where are those guys?  I guess we'll have to do it ourselves,
Mario!",

there's nothing left to do but grab
the Mini Paint Star!",

in my lunch today. Don't tell anyone
or they'll force-feed me kale!", 
O1_3FRightKinopioPhase7_01,"I've never seen anything like it...
Draggadon came to life and flew
away! I wonder where it went...", 
O1_TopKinopioPhase4_01,"Run!", 
O1_LateralLiftSavePhase5_01,"That big quake before was a little
too close for comfort!", 
O1_CheckerKinopioPhase5_01,"Do you think that...thing...was
causing all of these earthquakes
we've been having?", 
O1_3FLeftKinopioPhase7_01,"I never would have imagined that
we'd find such a complete specimen.ɘ
And that it would be so terrifying!", 
O1_3FRightKinopioPhase2_01,"Hello, Mario! Here to check out
our find?  Well, if you'd like a closer look, you
can enter through that hole and
go up the scaffolding. Please be
careful in there!", 
O1_LateralLiftPhase3_01,"Uh...I didn't get time for lunch
earlier, so I'm sneaking a quick
snack. Don't tell my boss!", 
O1_BuryKinopioPhase3_03_2,"Thanks for rescuing me.
I was getting so hungry and bored in
there!", 
O1_TailKinopioPhase5_01,"Thank goodness no one was hurt.
I mean... ǴYou weren't hurt, were
you, Mario?", 
O1_BuryKinopioPhase3_03_3,"Huh? Mario?", 
O1_CheckerKinopioPhase3_01,"Please be careful on the scaffolding.
It has been 0 days since our last
accident!", 
O1_BuryKinopioPhase4_01,"Eeeek!", 
O1_BuryKinopioPhase4_02,"What kind of monster was that?!  It seemed like it was mad at us!
Did we steal something from it?
Do we owe it money?", 
O1_BuryKinopioPhase4_03,"I can't believe it just blasted through
the wall like that...", 
O1_BuryKinopioPhase4_04,"But on the bright side, it did all of
our work for us. The fossil is
completely exposed!",
