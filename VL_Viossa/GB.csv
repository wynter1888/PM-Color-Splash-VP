You done did it now, Mario!  Without a trainer, Wild Dino

Hang on to your mustache!",

their game just gets me SO AMPED!",

vacation stuffed inside a musty old
trunk with a bunch of sweaty Toads.
Righteous!",

Lucky you.",

didn't make the cut.",

Where's that clown Lemmy?!", 
GB_Receipt_HEI00_4,"That's more like it. But there still
aren't enough people to fill the seats.  We need the line to be longer than
this. It's gotta at least go down the
slope back there.",

confusion! They're a rowdy bunch,
so be careful!",

I wonder what it is.",

That Lemmy guy made it disappear
before he escaped!",

I want my money back!",

Shy Guys, and they're all sold out!",

Bowser's underling! I knew it the

You a performer?
Nah, didn't think so.",

rough, but the stargazing was worth
it.",

can't put them in the circus yet.
Their tongues are a liability.",

It's so lively in here!  Every seat is full, and the audience
is giddy with anticipation!   I've never actually been to the
circus before, so I'm super excited!",

That joke used to kill back at
the recycling plant.  I thought maybe...because paper is
recyclable too...?",

burden of trying to stay optimistic.",

They liked THAT but my tin-can
impression flopped?!  Where was MY mushroom at?", 
GB_RedRescue42,"You're a good listener, Mario.
Everyone tells you their problems,
but not many people stop to ask:
How's Mario doing?",

Got any jokes up your sleeve?
Please tell me you've got something.", 
GB_RedRescue43,"Thanks again for rescuing me from  
Draggadon. Ahem!",

You're really fired up tonight, Mario.
You must've really enjoyed the show.  I admit defeat. A spectacular defeat!

Uh...",

party started!",

It's almost time for the grand finale!",

Emerald Circus!  The show will start as soon as the

My magic wand can transform into
a magic ball...  A Wonder Ball!
Yes, yes! Clap for the Wonder Ball!",

It is I, Lemmy, the greatest and most
humble illusionist in all the world!  The things you're about to see may
shock you. They might astound you.
But they'll definitely impress you.",

That didn't do squat!", 
GB_Battle_Boss_07,"Thing Cards?!
What is this, baby's first battle?
APPLAUSE!",

to vanish like that! What a
showman!", 
GB_Battle_Boss_08,"Here it comes—the grand finale!",

GB_MagicShow_Lemmy03,"That's right!

It's a shiny green Big Paint Star!  Now, watch closely!", 
GB_Battle_Boss_09,"This is it!
Wonder Ballistic!  Eheeheekee!
Go ahead and struggle!
It adds to the drama of it all!",

out to be a success.", 
GB_MagicShow_Lemmy05,"Heeheekee!
Now, wherever could the
Big Paint Star have gone?", 
GB_MagicShow_Lemmy06,"You, there! With the ridiculous
mustache and the rusty can.  Where do you think that extra-
special Big Paint Star ran off to?̠
You didn't need that, did you?  Heeheekeeeeeeeeee!", 
GB_StageBattle_Audience_03_01,"Good show!",

disappeared and then he was gone
and he never came back.",

we've done our job. Even if that
someone is us!", 
GB_Audience_KNP03_2,"Mario! The Rescue Squad has your
back. Good luck!", 
GB_RedRescue11,"This is just between you and me, but
the squad leader said he wants me
to replace him when he retires.", 
GB_Audience_KNP03_3,"I wonder why they left the
trampoline on the stage...", 
GB_RedRescue12,"♪Rescue ohh, rescue ohhh!
Rescue, beep beep, rescue,
Ohh rescue, rescue hey!♪", 
GB_RedRescue13,"You've already beaten Morton, Iggy,
Ludwig, Wendy, and Larry.
Just two Koopalings left!", 
GB_StageBattle_Yoshi_03,"What's this?
Who let that Yoshi out?!", 
GB_RedRescue14,"That guy the Shy Guys are talking
about... I wonder if it's another one
of Bowser's protégés?", 
GB_StageBattle_Yoshi_04,"Poor Mario!
That Yoshi ate your precious card,
didn't he?!", 
GB_RedRescue15,"Wanna know why I joined the Rescue
Squad? The rad uniforms!", 
GB_StageBattle_Yoshi_05,"Mario expertly guards himself against
the Yoshi's ravenous appetite!", 
GB_RedRescue16,"The 30 of us all joined the Rescue
Squad at the same time.
At least we're sticking together.", 
GB_Audience_KNP01_1,"There's an intermission already?!
This thing just started!", 
GB_RedRescue17,"I'm tired.", 
GB_Audience_KNP01_2,"Running away in the middle of the
show? Some hero you are!", 
GB_RedRescue18,"Hey...guy in front of me!
Quit dozing off!", 
GB_Audience_KNP01_3,"Mario!
What a show!
Were you following a script?", 
GB_RedRescue19,"I really wanted to join the blue 
Rescue Squad, but I'm a red Toad.
C'est la vie...", 
GB_Rescue_Leader01_3,"Thanks again for saving me back
there, Mario.  One of our informants told me that
there's a Big Paint Star inside
this circus tent.   The red Rescue Squad is gearing up
to bust in and seize it, but none of
my 49 squad members have shown
up yet!  If you see any red Rescue Squad
members at our headquarters in
Port Prisma, please send them my
way!  Over and out!", 
GB_StageBattle_Lemmy03_01,"Rigorous training has provided the
Buzzy Beetle Tower with a
world-class sense of balance!", 
GB_MagicShow_HEI02_2,"Lemmy's Super Illusion Show!", 
GB_StageBattle_Lemmy03_02,"Ooooh, the Spike Guy slips and falls!
Ouch!", 
GB_StageBattle_Lemmy03_03,"WHAT?!
They lost their balance?!
That's not in the script!", 
GB_AfterOpenTent_JHBRS01,"The ball that Lemmy rides is a lot
more fragile than it looks. I bet a
super-sharp Thing could pop it.  He'd have to be distracted first,
though.", 
GB_BossBattle_Lemmy01,"Well done! It seems I've been caught.", 
GB_BossBattle_Lemmy02,"For some reason, my magic wand
doesn't have any effect on the
Paint Star.  So the only way I could make it
disappear was to employ a little...
sleight of hand.  But no matter—the point of this
circus wasn't to show off my
magical prowess.  The point was to steal the Paint Star
and embarrass you in front of a giant
crowd at the same time!  And now it's time for the 
grand finale!
Heeheekee!", 
GB_Receipt_HEI01_2,"Oh yeah! Now that's an audience!
It's going to be a full house!  Thank you all for waiting!
Please go in and take your seats.", 
GB_MagicShow_HEI01,"Um, uh... Hey, folks.  We're experiencing some technical
difficulties. It seems that our main
performer has vanished! Hehhhh...  So please enjoy this unscheduled
intermission!", 
GB_RedRescue30,"Must've been pretty cool to see all
30 of us Toads explode out of 
that trunk, huh?", 
GB_MagicShow_HEI02,"Ladies and gentlemen,
Toads and Shy Guys,
plumbers of all ages!   You are moments away from
experiencing the Emerald Circus in
all its glory!   Without further ado, allow me to
introduce our first act. It's the show
everyone's talking about...", 
GB_BossBattle_Lemmy04,"You're back! Such tenacity.
Oooh, yes. I like you!  Come now—the show must go on!", 
GB_AfterBattle_Painky01,"Well...that was definitely the best
circus I've ever been to.  Now let's wake the Big Paint Star!
It's the last one!", 
GB_RedRescue31,"I was the second from the bottom
out of the 30 of us stuffed in that
train trunk. Meaning I was the 29th
to come out.", 
GB_MagicShow_HEI03,"WHAT?!
Lemmy disappeared?!
That's not in the script!", 
GB_RedRescue32,"I was on the very bottom of the
30-Toad stack in that train trunk.
Meaning I was the 30th to come out.", 
GB_MagicShow_HEI04,"Oh geez! ̠Oh no...̠
We've gotta stall!
Get out there and...̠do something!", 
GB_Audience_HEI02_1,"How did he do that?!
He just vanished into thin air!", 
GB_RedRescue33,"Thanks for defeating those creeps
who were running wild inside the
Sunset Express!", 
GB_Audience_HEI02_2,"Typical circus. What a letdown...", 
GB_RedRescue34,"Why can't it start until they sell
every last seat? Maybe it's not
profitable unless the tent is full.", 
GB_Audience_HEI02_3,"Where did Lemmy go?
Maybe he vanished to another
dimension!", 
GB_RedRescue35,"Hey, Mario! Remember me? Toad?
From that other game we were in
together?", 
GB_RedRescue36,"It was so cramped in that trunk!
My neck and shoulders are as stiff
as cardboard! I need a massage...", 
GB_Yoshi_Painky01,"Listen here, dino-dragon things!
It's not OK to go around eating
people whole.  I mean, you don't even know where
Mario has been! I'd go brush my
teeth, if I were you.", 
GB_RedRescue37,"I haven't seen a circus since I was
but a wee spore!", 
GB_Yoshi_Painky02,"HOW RUDE!
At least buy the guy dinner first.
Sheesh!", 
GB_RedRescue38,"Those fire-breathing dinosaurs!
I've never seen anything like them
before!", 
GB_RedRescue39,"I'm more excited about the illusions
than anything else! I hope they blow
my mind like ""P'SHEEEEEEEEEEW!""", 
GB_AfterOpenTent_JBBRS01,"Lemmy vanished into thin air?
Knowing him, it's probably part of
his act.  I bet he's somewhere shaking his
groove thing. I swear—that guy!
Once he hits the dance floor,
he's totally incapacitated!", 
GB_BOSS2nd_Painky03,"Mario!
Lemmy's Wonder Ball dodges
instantly, so you won't hit it with
a normal attack, but I have an idea.  Let's trick them into dancing, and
then pop the ball with something
sharp while their guard is down!", 
GB_Battle_Boss_10,"A discotheque with a Disco Ball!
The groove...is too much to bear!
I'VE GOT TO BOOGIE!", 
GB_Battle_Boss_11,"Oooh, you sly dog!
How am I supposed to defend myself
when I'm getting down? Ya dig?  I better hit you with the
Wonder Ball!", 
GB_RedRescue01,"I'm the first in line, which means that
I'll be the very first to go inside!
Yep, it feels good to be #1!", 
GB_RedRescue02,"No matter what I do, I'm #2.
Now I know what Luigi feels like...", 
GB_Battle_Boss_13,"Eheeheekee!
You think I care that you popped my
ball?  I don't care!
Because... I've got THIS!", 
GB_RedRescue03,"That trunk smelled like old socks.
Well, more like new socks that an
old person wore.", 
GB_Battle_Boss_14,"Now you see it! Now you don't!", 
GB_BossBattle_Painky01,"It's the green Big Paint Star!
It was probably up here all along!", 
GB_RedRescue04,"It was really quiet in the trunk, so I
was able to devote my thoughts to
the existential paradox of being
trapped in this trunk of mortality.", 
GB_Battle_Boss_15,"Bye-bye, card!
Surprised ya, huh?
APPLAUSE!", 
GB_StageBattle_Lemmy01,"Please welcome to the stage...  A terrifying green beast with eight
heads, sixteen eyes...̠and one wheel!  The trick-riding,̠ introverted̠
UNICYCLE SHY GUUUUUUUUYS!", 
GB_BossBattle_Painky02,"Huh?
There's a hole in the tent.  This must be where the star came 
out of the tent! Some illusion.  Does that mean...Lemmy came out
through this hole too?", 
GB_RedRescue05,"I noticed that my thumb is angled
slightly more inward than normal
when I salute. I should get that
checked out.", 
GB_Battle_Boss_16,"Oooh! Nicely done!
APPLAUSE!", 
GB_StageBattle_Lemmy02,"Well, THOSE guys are fired.
Speaking of fired...  Let's give an unseasonably warm
welcome to our next guests...  The fire-breathing dino beasts
and their miserable trainerrrrrrr!", 
GB_RedRescue06,"I'm really good at seeing through
illusions! I'll definitely see through
this, too!", 
GB_Battle_Boss_17,"NOOO! You popped my Wonder Ball!
Do you even know what that thing
retails for?!", 
GB_StageBattle_Lemmy03,"Let's keep this party rocking!  It's a balancing act the likes of which
the world has never seen!  Say hello to the iron-shelled
Buzzy Beetle Tower of TERROR!", 
GB_RedRescue07,"Rescue Squadet #12 sings the most
AMAZING rescue song. I get chills
every time I hear it.", 
GB_Battle_Boss_18,"That Ice Pick Replica looks like it's
from the bargain bin!", 
GB_StageBattle_Lemmy04,"Ahem... And now for the final act!  The high-flying acrobatic bad boys...
the Trampoline Shy Guys!", 
GB_RedRescue08,"Ugh, this line!
I'd rather be back in the trunk.", 
GB_Battle_Boss_19,"Oooh, you sly dog!
How am I supposed to defend myself
when I'm getting down? Ya dig?  And now for the grand finale!", 
GB_StageBattle_Audience_02_01,"Ohhhhh!", 
GB_StageBattle_Lemmy05,"And that's our show, folks!
Many thanks to the stars of our
show tonight...Mario and Hueeeey!  Thanks for joining us tonight. Don't
forget to stop by the merch table
on your way out!", 
GB_RedRescue09,"I haven't rescued a single person
since I joined the Rescue Squad.", 
GB_StageBattle_Audience_02_02,"Go!", 
GB_StageBattle_Lemmy06,"Awww. It looks like our star performer
has come down with a bad case of
stage fright!  Come back soon, Mario, so we can
give this crowd the entertainment
they deserve!", 
GB_StageBattle_Audience_02_03,"Aw yeah!", 
GB_StageBattle_Lemmy07,"Returning to the stage...
it's the one, the only...
MARIO!", 
GB_StageBattle_Lemmy08,"Let's take it from the top and give
this crowd its money's worth!  The show must go on!",

average, garden-variety Shy Guy.  Yes, you.
Don't look so surprised.",

The Trampoline Shy Guys fell down!", 
GB_Rescue_Leader03,"Roll call!", 
GB_FirstEntry_Painky01,"Ooh!
A giant tent in the middle of the
forest!  This must be the Emerald Circus,
right?",

nimbly dodge the blow with a
big jump!", 
GB_Rescue_Leader05,"All 50 members of the red Rescue

material! You should join us!", 
GB_MagicShow_Lemmy02_5,"You, sir! Have you seen him?",

cards or something.", 
GB_MagicShow_Lemmy02_6,"Thank you! Thank you!
You're easily entertained.", 
GB_Rescue_Leader00_0,"H... M...!", 
GB_RedRescue22,"I heard the Mushroom Kingdom
doesn't have Rescue Squads!

GB_RedRescue23,"Mario, sir! I'm a huge fan!
Thanks for taking the time to talk to
a normal Toad like me with no unique
traits or discernable characteristics!", 
GB_Rescue_Leader00_2,"Thanks a ton for rescuing me, Mario!
I went to pet a Yoshi, but it suddenly
chewed me up and spit me out!  I'm the leader of the red
Rescue Squad.", 
GB_RedRescue24,"Mario, are you helping us with our
mission? Get your head in the game!", 
GB_Rescue_Leader00_3,"Wish I could stay and chat, but I've
got to get to the rendezvous spot,
pronto!", 
GB_RedRescue25,"I don't really mind waiting in long
lines. Gives me time to contemplate
my mortality.",

haunted inn!)  Yoshi!

quickly! Sounds like a pretty good
circus act, if you ask me!",

of this cage.)  Yoshi!
(Though I'm not sure why they
wanted to get out so badly.)",

save the day, but at least we get
to enjoy the circus!",

(Looking closely, that cage isn't as
nice as I thought it was. I've decided
I want to be a cage-free Yoshi!)", 
GB_StageBattle_Lemmy02_02,"You extincted the Wild Dino Rhinos
and broke their trainer's heart!
Shame on you, Mario!", 
GB_Audience_HEI03_1,"I wonder if that magic wand is
really magic. Looks fake to me.", 
GB_RedRescue28,"All of us Toads stacked on one
another in that trunk must've looked
like some kind of Toad notebook.
A Toadbook, if you will!",
