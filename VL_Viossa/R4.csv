R4_Spa_RescueB00,"Hey, man. If you've got it, flaunt it.
And boy, have I got it.", 
R4_Spa_RescueB01,"You borrowing the dryer? Just be
sure to bring it back. It's no fun
being soggy all day!", 
R4_Restaurant_Painky01,"Well, Mario here is one of the best
jumpers I've ever seen! He could
probably go pro if he wanted.  So we'll go find the Thing you're
looking for and deliver it to the
Tangerino Grill.", 
R4_Restaurant_Painky02,"I thought he said he couldn't jump...", 
R4_Peep_HEI01,"*gulp*
It's so beautiful...", 
R4_Peep_HEI02,"Hey! It took us three hours to stack
up like this. Don't knock us over!", 
R4_Peep_HEI03,"What are you doing?! If we fall
down, we won't be able to get
back up again!  Find your own spot!", 
R4_Spa_TRS01,"Why, I never!", 
R4_Spa_KinopikoR00,"Eh...this hot spring could be hotter
if you ask me.", 
R4_Peep_HEI04,"*gasp*", 
R4_Spa_TRS02,"This is a ghosts-only spa!", 
R4_Drier_Painky01,"Hey...this Thing seems like it could
melt that huge block of ice at the
restaurant!", 
R4_Peep_HEI05,"But...̠we were just looking at the...̠
Paint Star...", 
R4_Spa_KinopikoC00,"Yeeow! It's a little toasty in here
for me, to be honest.", 
R4_Peep_HEI06,"Fall down go boom.", 
R4_Watch_Heiho00_2,"Now he said, ""This is my living room.
How would you like it if I just walked
into YOUR living room?""", 
R4_Watch_Heiho00_3,"He goes on. "I've got the temperature
set just the way I want it in here.""  "If you don't like it...TOO BAD!
Don't even think of letting any of
the heat out.""  "Do you even know how much it
costs to heat this place? The rocks
don't melt themselves, you know.""  I...I actually think he's wrong about
that. The rocks DO melt themselves.
But...he seems pretty mad anyway.", 
R4_Watch_Heiho00,"He said, ""Who are you? And what
are you doing in my volcano?""", 
R4_Watch_Heiho01,"He said, ""Back again? When will you
learn that FIRE beats PAPER?""", 
R4_Peep_HEI05_2,"Ow.", 
R4_Spa_KinopikoL00,"I feel like we know each other pretty
well, Mario. But not "watch each
other take baths"" well, you know?", 
R4_Spa_Heiho00,"Ahh!", 
R4_Spa_Heiho01,"Noooooo!", 
R4_Spa_Heiho02,"Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.", 
R4_Spa_RescueA00,"Oh, this hot spring is the BEST. The
perfect temperature. Ahhh...  I wish I could sit in here all day. But
I suppose it's about time to wring
myself out and get on with the day.", 
R4_Spa_Signboard,"Warning: Water contains water.
Water is hot. Water will get you
wet. Please do not sue us.", 
R4_Spa_Painky00,"So this is a hot spring. I guess I don't
really get the appeal of stewing
yourself like a tomato, but...  ...a little dip couldn't hurt.", 
R4_Spa_Painky01,"Ooh. Now I get it. I never want to
get out of here!  Sorry, Mario. You're on your own.", 
R4_Spa_Painky02,"Ahh...yes. ̠It's a shame our time 
together has to end this way, but
the water just feels soooo good.   Remember back when we found
our very first Paint Star together?
Good times, man. ̠Good times.  You know, I don't think I've ever
even thanked you for all you've
done for me.  I basically forced you to come on
this adventure. That's not cool.
I'm really sorry, dude.  Well,̠ I hope you find the princess
and everything.  You should come back here when
you do! ̠I'll be here, man.̠
I'm never leaving this place...", 
R4_TalkEnemy_MUC01,"Whoa, you actually found this
place? Respect.", 
R4_Spa_Painky03,"Wait, ̠what am I saying?! Let's get
out of here before I get too relaxed!̠
We've got Paint Stars to find!", 
R4_TalkEnemy_MUC02,"You know, it's good to move forward,
but sometimes you have to look back
at where you've been, too.  Did I sound like a life coach just
then? ϨGood! I've been working on
opening a private practice.", 
R4_Spa_Painky04,"Mario, you're gonna get prune
fingers. Let's get out of here!", 
R4_TalkEnemy_MUC03,"Ahhhhhh...
I'm not even a Snifit anymore, man.
I'm converting to a Soakit.", 
R4_Btl_Bubble_Heiho00,"Oh, he's giving you a warning. That's
pretty thoughtful for an enemy!  He said, "I'm literally made of fire, 
and you're made of paper. Good
luck, kindling. Bahaha!""  So...maybe not as thoughtful as I
originally thought.", 
R4_TalkEnemy_MUC04,"Yeah, me too. Bowser works us
too hard...", 
R4_Btl_Bubble_Heiho01,"Well, now he's just taunting you.
""I warned you about touching me,
didn't I?""  ""Fight fire with fire! Not with cheap
hammers and flimsy boots.""", 
R4_Spa_Kinopiko00,"Huh?", 
R4_Spa_Kinopiko01,"What?!", 
R4_Spa_Kinopiko02,"Agh!", 
R4_Restaurant_KNP01,"Ah, Mario! Maybe you can help
me out with something.  I work at the Tangerino Grill, and
we've got this huge block of ice
taking up space in our freezer.  The chef asked me to come here to
find something to melt the ice,
but I can't jump that high.  Got any pointers for me?
I've never been any good at jumping.", 
R4_Restaurant_KNP02,"Wow, really?!
Thanks a bunch!  I'm still on the clock, so I'm gonna go
take a nap somewhere and rack up
some overtime pay!", 
R4_Peep_HEI06_2,"Uhhh...", 
R4_Hole_Painky01,"Hey, I can smell a Paint Star on the
other side of this wall!", 
R4_Peep_HEI04_2,"PAIN...", 
R4_Hole_Painky02,"It's too steamy to see clearly...
There must be another hot spring
on that side.",
