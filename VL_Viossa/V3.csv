V3_House_HEI01,"Welcome to our secret little parallel
world!  Here's a handy tip: the pipe in the
garden will take you back to the
normal world.  I hope you won't abuse this curious
phenomenon to make trouble for us!", 
V3_Landry_Battle_HEI5_01,"Not so fast!", 
V3_Landry_Battle_HEI5_02,"Our clothes were in there! You ruined
five perfectly good hoods!  You'll pay for this...", 
V3_Deck_KNP01,"Have you got business on the island?
Well, good luck to you!", 
V3_Stone_KNP00_2,"That look on your face tells me...Ĭ
Oh no...don't tell me this has been
happening everywhere...even in
Port Prisma...  And I thought MY problem was bad!", 
V3_Deck_KNP02,"We'll just sit back and chill on the
ship until you get back.", 
V3_Deck_PKNP01,"Have you grown fond of Vortex
Island, Mario?", 
V3_Bridge_PKNP01,"We can't go any farther, but I'll be
darned if that'll stop us from trying!", 
V3_UzuWatch_Painky01,"Has Mr. Captain given up already?
If we don't do something about this
whirlpool, we won't be able to get
that Paint Star, you know.", 
V3_UzuWatch_Painky02,"Aw, come on. We can't just give up
when there's a Mini Paint Star so
close by.  We'll think of something.", 
V3_Bridge_HEI01,"You can build a bridge there!  Rather than waiting for a miracle,
you should roll up your sleeves and
make your own path.", 
V3_Bridge_HEI02,"See? It's not a miracle at all.
Just required a little elbow grease.", 
V3_Garden_HEI01,"The sky is heavy and cloudy again
here in our world. It's the perfect
climate for doing some laundry.", 
V3_Entrance_Painky01,"Well, that famous whirlpool is
keeping us from saving a precious
Paint Star! Is there anything that
can be done?", 
V3_UzuWatchAfter_PKNP01,"Yahaharr!  We wished with all our considerable
might that the whirlpool would go
away, and it did!  Scares the spores out me, mate.
I didn't ask for this much power!
Let's get back to the ship.", 
V3_Entrance_Painky02,"Excuse me, but that whirlpool isn't
here anymore.", 
V3_Entrance_KNP00,"One of Bowser's stooges chased me
all the way out to this little island...Ĭ
with a straw!  Normally I stand on the wharf and
welcome visitors to the island, but I
was so scared from the chase that I
completely forgot!", 
V3_Entrance_KNP01,"This is Vortex Island, famous for its
giant whirlpool.", 
V3_Entrance_KNP02,"I'm afraid no one knows how the
whirlpool started or how to stop it.  Plus, I mean...we've got a pretty
cool little gift shop going with
whirlpool-themed souvenirs...", 
V3_FourPile_KNP01,"I wonder what these posts look like
in the parallel world... Probably like
giant egg rolls!", 
V3_FourPile_KNP02,"Someone must have eaten those
giant parallel egg rolls.", 
V3_Tresure_HEI01,"I want to hit that post, but
I don't even have a hammer!", 
V3_Tresure_HEI02,"You hit the post. Ĭ
You're everything I wish I was.", 
V3_Landry_Battle_NOK_01,"Wait just one minute!", 
V3_Landry_Battle_NOK_02,"My best Sunday shell was in that
washing machine!", 
V3_UzuStop_PKNP05,"The whirlpool be no more.
Let's go get that Mini Paint Starrrrrr.", 
V3_TurnBack_Painky01,"But...there's a Mini Paint Star sitting
there in the center...just waiting for
us to grab it!", 
V3_SealDokan_Painky00,"Let's start by reviving that Toad!", 
V3_SealDokan_KNP01,"Oh, my beautiful color!
Thank you so much, Mario!  Say, what are you doing around
these parts, anyway?", 
V3_SealDokan_Painky01,"We're in a bit of a bind! Our ship is
stuck because of that whirlpool.", 
V3_SealDokan_Painky02,"What?! A parallel world...identical
in every way?! What are we waiting
for, Mario? Let's go!", 
V3_UzuStop_KNP2_01,"Now we can get that Mini Paint Star
that was above the whirlpool!", 
V3_SealDokan_KNP03,"In that case, I'll tell you a closely
guarded secret of our island.
You did rescue me after all.  There exists a parallel world on
Vortex Island... A world identical to
this one in every way.", 
V3_Garden_KNP02_01,"I fell into the washing machine while
it was on the hot setting, and all my
color got washed out!  My mom warned me about this...  I'm still a bit damp, so I'm just gonna
hang out here and think about what
I've done.", 
V3_SealDokan_KNP04,"And believe it or not, the entrance
to this parallel world is in my
back garden! Convenient, no?  Please feel free to use it. You might
find some clues there to solving your
whirlpool problem.", 
V3_Pile_HEI01,"If the post is in the way, then...I
think it'd be OK to give it a whack!", 
V3_SealDokan_KNP07,"Well, the parallel world is ALMOST
identical. There may be a massive
army of paint-thirsty enemies there.", 
V3_Pile_HEI02,"The post was in the way...so you
just hit it, eh?  I hope that's not how you deal with
all of the obstacles in your life.", 
V3_Sail_KNP01,"Let me know if you want to leave
the island. I'm sure the captain will
understand.", 
V3_Sail_KNP02,"The captain has instructed me not
to weigh anchor just yet.  He wants to talk to you first, Mario.", 
V3_Entrance_HEI01,"You're not from around here,
are you?", 
V3_UzuWatchAfter_HEI01,"What happened to the tornado?  I wonder if my hood is clean yet...", 
V3_FourPile_HEI01,"Don't waste your time on these
posts. They're not going anywhere.", 
V3_FourPile_HEI02,"Well, THAT was strange. The posts
sank into the ground on their own!
I bet it was the normies doing weird
normal things in the normal world!", 
V3_UzuWatch_PKNP01,"Thar she blows!  I've seen a whirlpool or two in my
day, but never one this powerful.  I can't imagine there's anything
in this world we can do about it...", 
V3_Goal_PKNP01,"All right...grab that thing, and let's
be on our way.  We're so close to Fortune Island...", 
V3_Entrance_KNP01_2,"This is Vortex Island.
I mean...Ǵit WAS Vortex Island.  Like, I know the whirlpool was a
giant problem for sailors, but now I'm
stuck with 500 ""Vortex Island Sucks""
novelty T-shirts!", 
V3_UzuWatch_PKNP02,"What are we supposed to do here?!", 
V3_Goal_PKNP03,"What ye be waiting for, mate?
Grab that Paint Starrrrrrrrrrrrr!", 
V3_Stone_KNP00,"Thanks for saving me, Mario!
Some Shy Guys ambushed me and
slurped all of my paint away!  Do...do you think they caused all
of these weird blank spots, too?", 
V3_TurnBack_PKNP01_0,"Belay the vessel!", 
V3_Stone_KNP01,"You really want to hear about my
problem? I'll warn you—it's not for
the faint of heart!  See this stone post here?
It's blocking the way into the
garden, and I REALLY want to save
my progress!  I must stay strong.
I must not power off...", 
V3_Stone_KNP02,"The stone pillar moved!  I was finally able to save!", 
V3_Bridge_KNP01,"There used to be a bridge here.
I'm not sure what happened to it.  It'd probably take a miracle for us
to get a new one. Those mainland
landlubbers are always defunding
our island's infrastructure!  Sorry, didn't mean to go all political
on you...", 
V3_Bridge_KNP02,"A bridge appeared!
IT'S A MIRACLE!", 
V3_Bridge_KNP03,"It's surely a miracle,
but it's not finished yet!", 
V3_KinopioHouse_Painky01,"Ah! Maybe the Toad who lives here
can tell us something useful...", 
V3_UzuStop_KNP1_01,"Just wishing for the whirlpool to
disappear was a bit of a long shot...
But what else could we do?", 
V3_Landry_HEI01,"Today is a perfect day for doing
laundry. I chucked in all the dirty
stuff that's been piling up lately.", 
V3_Landry_HEI02,"How dare you wring that out!
It was right in the middle of the
spin cycle!", 
V3_Landry_HEI03,"Hey, look—it's the jerk who wrung
out the washing machine while all
of my laundry was still in it...", 
V3_Garden_KNP01,"What are you doing here, Mario?
Are you thinking of visiting the
parallel world?  That pipe is the entrance...but we
taped it up to avoid any accidents.
It's way too scary for us in there!  Please be careful whatever you do.", 
V3_Garden_KNP02,"That pipe is the entrance to the
parallel world. Please be careful, OK?", 
V3_UzuWatch_HEI01,"That tornado is so cool...  I wonder what it looks like in the
quote-unquote normal world...", 
V3_Landry_Battle_MG_BRS_01,"Hold it!", 
V3_Landry_Battle_MG_BRS_02,"I lost my scarf, my gloves, AND my
socks! If it weren't for these shades,
I'd be naked!", 
V3_UraFirst_Painky01,"""It's identical in every way!""
Yeah, right. This place is creepy!", 
V3_TurnBack_PKNP01,"We almost broke the first rule of
sailing—never sail into a vortex,
no matter how fun it looks.", 
V3_TurnBack_PKNP02,"Sorry, mate. There's no way we can
reach it while the sea be raging like
this.  Let's make land over there for
now.", 
V3_Land_PKNP01,"We'll go ashore first and see about
that whirlpool.  Take yer time and meet us there.
We'll try to figure out what to do
before ye catch up with us.", 
V3_Goal_Painky01,"Right, Mario, let's go!
Yo ho ho!", 
V3_Land_PKNP02,"YARRRRRRRGH!
To fortune!", 
V3_Tresure_KNP01,"I bet that treasure chest is full of
amazing stuff, but it's too high for
me to reach.  If that stone pedestal were lower,
well, that'd be another story.", 
V3_Tresure_KNP02,"The treasure chest lowered by itself!  Could it be...a cursed treasure
chest?! No way I'm opening that
thing!", 
V3_UzuWatchAfter_Painky01,"Eh...Ǵlet's not tell him. He seems
motivated right now, so let's just
roll with it.", 
V3_Tresure_KNP03,"So there were Battle Cards inside
that treasure chest?!  It wasn't cursed after all! Unless,
of course, the Battle Cards are
cursed... Oooooowoowoowoo!",
