I hope you enjoy my
Cannon in Sea Major!",

Aren't we doing well?", 
BB_BossBattle_Zako_04,"Bomb squad reporting for battle!",

all stealthy over here!", 
BB_BossBattle_Ludwig_03,"Grrrreh!
My ship has taken serious damage!  Don't think I'm going to let it happen

million. That's not...too bad.
Hehhhh.   Oh, Mario!  This training is really hard!
My glutes are starting to crease!", 
BB_BossBattle_Ludwig_05,"Gwehehe! This was my plan all
along! The Ludship was just a
temporary design!  Say hello to the flagship of my fleet:
the Super Ludsub!  Go ahead—just try to attack it.
Gwehehe!", 
BB_BossBattle_2nd_01,"Mario, the Super Ludship's cannons
are gonna be a problem. Blocking
isn't going to get us anywhere.  Do you have any cards that will
allow you to repel the cannonballs
back?", 
BB_BlueRescue18_01,"I have the absolute WORST luck.  You see those three fence panels?
I know one of them is the weak link.  But no matter what I do, I NEVER
guess the right one.  So help a guy out. You're a lucky 
guy! Show me what real luck is!", 
BB_BossBattle_Ludwig_06,"Gwehehe!
It's pointless! Futile!  No matter what attack you use,
you can't hit my ship while it's
underwater!", 
BB_BossBattle_2nd_02,"Watch out, Mario! He can probably
dive underwater to avoid your
counterattacks.  Think! Is there a way to bring him to
the surface so you can attack him?", 
BB_BlueRescue18_02,"One of these three fence panels is
the weak link that can be knocked
over.  I've had NO luck picking the right
one, but you're a lucky guy, right?
Show me how it's done.", 
BB_BossBattle_Ludwig_07,"Super Ludsub, dive!  Huh?
Dive! DIVE!  Why won't you dive?!", 
BB_BlueRescue18_03,"Mario, that was amazing!  I feel luckier just watching you!", 
BB_BossBattle_Ludwig_08,"You wrecked my Super Ludsub!
HOW DARE YOU!", 
BB_BossBattle_Ludwig_09,"Gweheh! You're going to fight my
Super Ludship with THOSE cards?  You'd best turn tail and run!", 
BB_Ludwig_01,"But you did show up a little, uh,
earlier than I anticipated, so we
had to cut production a bit...short.", 
BB_Ludwig_02,"Mario...  The world-famous Super Mario...
I wanted to fight you, if only once.  That's why I lured you in here
with the Big Paint Star.  But it looks like I underestimated
you. I admit defeat.  Even now, I'm glad that I got
to trade blows with you.  I guess I'll just have to hope
Lord Bowser can defeat you...  Good-bye.", 
BB_Ludwig_03,"You came back! Gwehehe!
Typical hero type!  Let's go!", 
BB_Stockyard_Painky01,"This fort...
There's no mistaking that smell.
The blue Big Paint Star is here!",

might be effective against the new 
superweapon they're developing.", 
BB_Ludwig_04,"Gwehehe!", 
BB_Cafe_12_2,"I've got some intel about the
new weapon they're developing.", 
BB_Ludwig_05,"I've been waiting, Mario!  I designed this weapon specifically
for you. I think you're gonna LOVE it.  Gaze upon its glory!
Cower in fear of its might!", 
BB_Cafe_12_3,"When it dives underwater, try using
something that can pull it back up.
Something real floaty-like, ya dig?  That's all I got.", 
BB_Ludwig_06,"Gwehehehe!
My new anti-Mario weapon!  Ludwig's Megabad Super Battleship
of Dooooooooooom!  But its friends call it the
Super Ludship!
What do you think?
Isn't it FIERCE?", 
BB_Cafe_10,"The Magma Burger is our most
popular dish. Only 200 coins! *  Ĭ Cafe_BuySelect01", 
BB_Cafe_12_4,"Take these with you.
They might come in handy.
*wink*", 
BB_Ludwig_07,"You're right. I do have the blue
Big Paint Star.  But I'm not just going to let you take
it...  If you really want it, you'll have
to get through me and my 
Super Ludship!  Come at me!", 
BB_Cafe_11,"Would you like something else?   ĬBB_Cafe_03", 
BB_Cafe_12_5,"I've got some more intel about that
new weapon they're developing.", 
BB_Cafe_12,"OK. Just act natural, and listen up.   This café is a front.
I'm a highly trained superspy who
just happens to make the best darn
latte this side of Redpepper Volcano.", 
BB_Cafe_12_6,"I'm collecting new intel all the time,
so check back with me if you're
having trouble.", 
BB_Cafe_14,"Oh, sorry! We're fresh out of those!
It's our best seller!  Hopefully they'll be back in stock
next time you visit.
Come again!", 
BB_Cafe_15,"The Tail card is effective against the
weapon these guys are developing.  That's all I got for you...for now.
Scram before they get suspicious!
And then come see me later...", 
BB_Cafe_17,"I heard you destroyed the enemy's
new superweapon.
Nice work, comrade.", 
BB_BlueRescue04_01,"Oh, Mario! The barista here
hooked me up with some
coffee for my stakeout!  I think he might sympathize
with our cause!  Oh, by the way, the secret password
is...Ǵpretzel. No, wait...Ǵthat's not
right. It's seashell! No...Ǵthat's not
quite right either.  Hmm...it was a pretty ordinary
word...nothing special about it
at all. Oh well.", 
BB_Cafe_18,"For a limited time we're offering the
Booyah Meal! It's the Magma Burger

You found him.", 
BB_Army_MUC03,"Now, listen up!
Mario may look tough on paper,
but he's not that tough...̠on paper.", 
BB_Training_HEI_Battle01,"Our personal trainer is gone!
We're free!", 
BB_Army_MUC04,"Even when they stacked up,
they didn't...̠stack up.  Retreeeeeeeeeeeat!", 
BB_FencePainky01,"Mario, it seems like the fence panels
get shuffled around each time you
hit one.  If only we could keep track of which
fence panels you've already hit...", 
BB_Army_MUC05,"H-he's back!
Get him!", 
BB_Army_MUC06,"My men... Decimated!", 
BB_Army_Painky01,"Guess he ran away WITHOUT his
tail between his legs. Ha! Get it?!", 
BB_BlueRescue06_Painky01,"Whew! That was a good workout.
Been a while since I got my paint
pumping like that!", 
BB_Army_MUC03_1,"Stack up, soldiers!
GO! GO! GO!", 
BB_Training_MUC_Battle01,"Hmm... 
The front line seems a little risky.",

I'm practically invisible in this 
inconspicuous cardboard box!  We received intel that the enemy is
developing a secret weapon at
Fort Cobalt.  We decided to infiltrate the place
ourselves, but we're in over our caps.  Now that you're here,
I'll leave the rest to you!", 
BB_BlueRescue06_03,"Phew! I'm ready to call it quits.", 
BB_Army_MUC01_2,"They'll be using covert tactics, so I
want you to search this place from
top to bottom, back to front!", 
BB_BlueRescue21_01,"Every day, from dawn to dusk,
it's just training, training, and
more training.  Everyone else was getting ripped!
But I didn't like the sound of that,
so I ran. And now I'm stuck here.", 
BB_BlueRescue21_03,"Gah! I totally tried that. Guess I
hadn't blasted my core hard
enough to have the strength.
Oh, well...thanks, Mario!", 
BB_Ludwig_Painky01,"Quit bragging, you classically trained
half-wit! There's a Big Paint Star
here—I know it!  You can't hide it from me! I can smell
things. Things normal paint cans only
dream of smelling!", 
BB_BossBattle_Ludwig_10,"Not even you could withstand my
power, Mario...  Now, meet your doom.
Lud-Cannon Blast!", 
BB_Cafe_HEI01,"Man, that was spicy.
But it so was worth it...",
