R1_Cafe_HEI04_01,"Dude, if that knife and fork on the
sign fell off... Eeeeeeh...
I don't even want to think about it.", 
R1_House_In01,"Oh, Mario!", 
R1_House_In02,"I hope those Toads realize breaking
and entering is a crime!
Can't you, like...arrest them or
something? You're Mario!", 
R1_House_In03,"They said the door was jammed,
but it's totally fine. I think they
were just lonely.  But they gave my house a fresh coat
of paint on their way out, so I'm not
gonna press charges.", 
R1_Rescue_Leader01_2,"We received reports that people are
having trouble getting past this cliff.", 
R1_House_Group01,"FINALLY!", 
R1_RollGround_MSG_KINOPIO01,"Look, Mario. You may have saved all
of our lives countless times, but that
doesn't mean you can cut in line.", 
R1_Rescue_Leader01_3,"Unfortunately, none of my three
squaddies have arrived yet.
They should've been here by now!  If you run into any purple squaddies
anywhere, send them my way,
yeah?  Over and out!", 
R1_House_Group02,"I'm free!", 
R1_Rescue_Leader01_4,"We mobilized to see if we can find a
way to scale it.", 
R1_RollGround_MSG_Signboard01,"- Beware the Paint Thieves! -", 
R1_PartyTalk_PHEI01,"Take me back to the Paint Star,
and I'll repaint it. I'll follow you.", 
R1_RollGround_MSG_KINOPIO03,"They rolled up Ruddy Road! 
My café is sky-high!  What am I supposed to do now?
Someone probably already owns the
trademark for Sky-High Café!", 
R1_Rescue_Leader01_5,"Unfortunately, none of my three
squaddies have arrived yet.
They should've been here by now!  If you see any purple Rescue Squad
members at our HQ in Port Prisma,
please tell them to meet me here!  Over and out!", 
R1_RollGround_MSG_KINOPIO04,"Looks like it's stuck to the ground
somehow. It's no use hitting it from
this side.", 
R1_FirstEvent_Painky01,"This is where the red Mini Paint Star
led us. Ruddy Road!   OK, Mario.
Let's look for the next Paint Star!", 
R1_RollGround_MSG_KINOPIO03_2nd,"Can't you, I don't know, unroll the
ground somehow, Mario?", 
R1_SwitchPlaces_TNKinopio01,"Oh, this place is perfect!
No people around at all!
This is a real sad mess of a café!", 
R1_SwitchPlaces_TNKinopio02,"Beautiful.
Thanks for telling me about this
café, Mario.  This should cover your finder's fee.", 
R1_FindStar_Painky01,"There it is! There's a Mini Paint Star
over there!", 
R1_Rescue_Step01,"3", 
R1_Rescue_Step02,"2", 
R1_MayimMayim_HEI01,"We dances in circles,
We slurps up da paint!
If you think that's yer business, 
Trust me, it ain't!", 
R1_FindStar_Painky03,"THAT PUNK!", 
R1_Rescue_Step03,"1", 
R1_MayimMayim_Painky01,"What the heck is going on here?!", 
R1_FindStar_Painky04,"After him!
We'll make him pay for this...", 
R1_Rescue_Step04,"Captain!", 
R1_MayimMayim_Painky02,"They're making a break for it!", 
R1_RollGround_MSG_PHEI03_2,"You'll probably want to supervise me
to make sure I don't try anything
funny.", 
R1_Cafe_HEI01_01,"I got nervous having so many people
in line behind me, so I just ordered
the first thing on the menu...", 
R1_House_In01_2,"I was just lounging around my house
when all of a sudden a gaggle of
Toads forced their way in!  There wasn't any space left, so I had
to cram myself into that bureau.
IN MY OWN HOUSE!  Looks like they all left though.
Thanks for getting them out of here.
Here, take this!", 
R1_Dash_Kinopio01,"No one messes with my café and
gets away with it!", 
R1_House_Out01,"Oh, hey, Mario!  We were all on a walk together when
some Shy Guys showed up, so we
all hid in this house!  But somehow the door got
jammed, and we all got stuck
in there.  It got pretty awkward,Ĭ and I'm
probably going to move to a new
town.̠ Anyway, thanks for saving us!", 
R1_Cafe_HEI01,"I was so excited about being first in
line that I forgot I'm allergic to
coffee!", 
R1_Cafe_HEI02,"I love lines! I don't even know what
this line is for! Don't even care!", 
R1_Cafe_HEI03,"You trying to cut in line?!
UNFORGIVABLE!", 
R1_RollGround_MSG_KINOPIO01_3,"Sorry, Mario. Had a huge lunch rush
today, and we're fresh out of
everything!  Maybe lay off the snooze button
a bit, eh, big guy?", 
R1_Cafe_HEI04,"Is this line even moving?
SOOOO BOOOOOORED.", 
R1_Cafe_HEI05,"Is this that café with the really
overrated coffee? Can't wait to
waste my hard-earned coins on it!", 
R1_FindStar_Painky02_02,"Where ya going, genius?!
Get over here and grab the Mini
Paint Star already!", 
R1_Press_Kinopio02,"Oh, Mario!
Good timing!  Those masked guys may have tipped
well, but I can't forgive them after
what they did to my café...  I'm trying to teach them a lesson,
but I've been doing Pilates, so I'm
not heavy enough to squash them.  But I was thinking if we jump at the
same time, we could give 'em
a real stomping!  C'mon. Pleeeease?", 
R1_Rescue_Leader04_1,"Keep an eye out for my purple
squaddies! We're still waiting on
 %d of them.", 
R1_FindStar_Painky02_03,"Huh?̠
But... ̠But why didn't it go flying off
when you touched it?", 
R1_Cafe_HEI05_01,"This coffee is really expensive, but
at least it's...̠drinkable. *gulp*", 
R1_Rescue_Leader04_2,"All purple squaddies present and
accounted for!", 
R1_FindStar_Painky02_04,"HOLD UP! What in The Lost Levels
is going on here?  Look! LOOOOOK!
The color!
It's been drained!  This is a sick world we live in!", 
R1_FindStar_Painky02_05,"Come on, let's take this Paint Star!", 
R1_Press_Kinopio05,"The customer is NOT always right!  WOO! I feel so much better!
Back to the café with me!
Thanks, Mario!", 
R1_SwitchPlaces_Painky01,"Yeah, I guess we did squash all of
your clientele.   But, come to think of it...
There was someone looking
for a café like this.", 
R1_Press_Kinopio06,"You know, it felt good to smoosh
those guys, but now I don't
have any customers left.  What's the point of having a café
without customers? If a cup of coffee
is brewed but not drunk, is it even
coffee?", 
R1_SwitchPlaces_Painky02,"Oh, and isn't that convenient?
Here he is right here!
It's the barista from Prisma Café!", 
R1_Press_Kinopio07,"The sign being upside down really
adds to the dumpy aesthetic.
It's perfect.", 
R1_Rescue_Leader02_2,"Greetings, Mario! I'm the captain of
the purple Rescue Squad.  If you see any purple Rescue Squad
members at our HQ in Port Prisma,
please tell them to meet me here!  Over and out!", 
R1_Press_Kinopio02_2,"I can't forgive these customers for
wrecking my café.  If we jump at the same time, we
could give them a real stomping!", 
R1_Cafe_HEI03_01,"What? You want my seat?
Buzz off, plumber boy!", 
R1_SwitchPlaces_TNKinopio01_2,"Hey, would you be interested in
switching cafés with me? You could
take my café in Port Prisma.  It's always been my dream to be a
suffering café owner, just barely
scraping by!", 
R1_PreemptiveAttack_Painky01,"It's another one of those weirdos!", 
R1_FindStar_Painky01_2,"That was easier than I thought it
would be.  Hurry up and grab it so it can
show us the way to the next
Paint Star!", 
R1_PreemptiveAttack_Painky02,"...Huh?
He hasn't noticed us yet. This is our
chance to get the jump on him.   If you jump on an enemy or whack it
with your hammer before battle
starts, you'll do some early damage!  Also, you can change your battle
controls in the menu. The advanced
controls allow you to set and
paint cards in one step!", 
R1_RescueLeader_Painky01,"Yeah, only because Mario caught
them slacking off.", 
R1_RollGround_MSG_PHEI01,"
 Beware the Incredibly
 Handsome Paint Thieves!", 
R1_Rescue_Leader01,"Greetings, Mario! I'm the captain of
the purple Rescue Squad.", 
R1_RollGround_MSG_PHEI02,"OK, you got me. I give up. 
I regret my life choices.", 
R1_Rescue_Leader02,"Hey, Mario. 
It's still me, the captain of the
purple Rescue Squad!  If you run into any of my three
purple team members, send them
my way, OK?  Over and out!", 
R1_RollGround_MSG_PHEI03,"OK. I will now...un-slurp the
paint from the Paint Star.", 
R1_SwitchPlaces_Kinopio01,"A customer! YEEEEEEAH!
I haven't had a customer in ages!  Oh... Never mind. It's just you, Mario.
Welp, that settles it. Time to close up
shop and give up on my dream.", 
R1_Rescue_Leader03,"Roll call!", 
R1_RollGround_MSG_PHEI04,"There.
Good as new.", 
R1_SwitchPlaces_Kinopio02,"UHHHHHHH...< WHAT?!
But the Prisma Café is world famous!
You've got customers out the ears!  I mean, if you really want this place,
then yeah—I'll trade with you!", 
R1_SwitchPlaces_Kinopio03,"Awesome! Starting today I'm the
proprietor of the Prisma Café!
I'm gonna work my stem off!", 
R1_Rescue_Leader05,"Er... Yes. And it looks like we
need to help out Mario now!", 
R1_Rescue_Leader06,"Purple Rescue Toads!
Commence Operation STEP IT UP!", 
R1_Rescue_Leader07,"You're on, Mario!", 
R1_Rescue_Leader08,"Mario! Don't just leave us here like
this!", 
R1_Rescue_Leader09," Mission accomplished!  Mario, you should be able to scale
the cliff now. Go for it!", 
R1_MayimMayim_Painky02_2,"Don't let them get away!  They're sucking the very life out
of this beautiful island!", 
R1_RollGround_MSG_PHEI04_2,"So, am I free to go?   Or is this...̠the end of the road?̠
Heh...", 
R1_Cafe_HEI02_01,"Owwwwwwwwwwww...
I burned mah mouf on the coffee.", 
R1_RollGround_MSG_PHEI02_2,"I'll return the paint I stole.
It's like they say: you can't fight
city hall. Or city plumbing.  C'mon—let's head back to that Paint
Star thing. After you, I insist.",
