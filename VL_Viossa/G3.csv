G3_LabRoomIn_Painky03,"Cat food? How dare you! Let me
outta this thing!", 
G3_LabRoomIn_Painky04,"Mario, that might have been one
of our Paint Stars!  We should take a closer look at this
monitor.  So...green Toad Science Guy...can
you let me down? And turn this
thing on?", 
G3_LabRoomIn_Painky05,"Uh, Mario? You weren't planning
on just leaving me here, were you?", 
G3_LabRoomIn_Painky06,"Urgh! All the paint has gone to my
head! I could really use a good
five minutes in a shaker...", 
G3_LabRoomIn_Painky07,"My advice? GET ME OUTTA HERE!", 
G3_LabRoom_Book,"-Slightly Strange Monitor Lab Report-  I've discovered a slightly strange
monitor. Less strange than THE
strange monitor, but strange
nonetheless!  Preliminary research suggests that
it is used primarily for displaying
boring codes, and as such, it has
been summarily destroyed.", 
G3_LabRoom_KNP10,"That shooting star came zooming out
all of a sudden! This must be one of
those new high-def 3D monitors.", 
G3_LabRoom_KNP11,"Sometimes I stay up all night
researching this particular
set of images and sounds!", 
G3_LabRoom_KNP13,"Ah, yes! My latest experiment. I've 
been measuring brain activity in
response to these ancient images.  I can't make heads or tails of them,
but they seem to make a lot of
people quite happy.  Isn't it fascinating how the images
seem to scroll from side to side?
And look at all of those platforms!", 
G3_LabRoom_KNP16,"Mario, with your help, I've finally
solved all of the mysteries contained
within this monitor!  Of course, I'm a little sad that I won't
be staying up all night researching
anymore...  But perhaps there are more bleepy
bloopy mysteries out there in the
universe. Perhaps life itself is one big
bleepy bloopy mystery...", 
G3_LabRoom_Painky12_2,"By the way, what is all of this
nonsense on the screen?  And that music...it's making me so...Ǵ
happy and nostalgic...Ǵfor some
reason.", 
G3_LabOutside_Painky11,"So...if I remember correctly, lightning
tends to strike tall, metal objects.", 
G3_DotStart_Painky01,"Whoa, this is so WEIRD!
Everything's all...̠bleepy and bloopy!", 
G3_DotStart_Painky02,"Hmm...this is a bit of a problem.", 
G3_DotStart_Painky03,"Wow! That's even crazier than I
expected. You should try doing
this all over the place!  The only thing is...I can only help
you hold this perspective for a little
bit at a time. Like...10 seconds.  When the time is up, you'll pop back
into the real world. I mean...ʼthe
real fake world that we're in.  Anyway, if you want to go back to
normal before 10 seconds have
passed, just press  again, OK?
Have fun, and be careful!", 
G3_LabRoomIn_KNP04_2,"Oh, ho, ho! Of course not! Weren't
you listening to anything I said?
I don't have any power!  Of course, you're welcome to look
around my laboratory a bit, if you
think you can figure something out...", 
G3_DotStart_Painky07," ＹＯＵ　ＧＯＴ　Ａ
 ＭＩＮＩ　ＰＡＩＮＴ　ＳＴＡＲ！", 
G3_DotStart_Painky08,"Well, that flag seems important
somehow. Maybe it's how we
get out of this place.  Why don't you try jumping on it?
You know, like you do at the end
of a Cutout sometimes!", 
G3_DotStart_Painky09,"Hey, look at that!  It might be all weird and chunky,
but that smells like a Paint Star
to me!", 
G3_DotStart_Painky02_1,"Let's try changing our perspective
a little bit.   This is going to use up a little bit of
paint, but it's totally worth it.
So, go ahead and press  and see
what happens... ", 
G3_LabRoom_Painky12,"Yeah, you're welcome, science guy.  Hey, Mario, check it out. I can
practically smell our Paint Star
through this screen.  Based on the minty-fresh scent, I'd
say it's a green Mini Paint Star
we're after.", 
G3_LabRoom_Painky13,"Yes...fascinating.  Anyway, I'm positive that one of
our missing Paint Stars is in there.  Can you...can you get US in there
somehow?", 
G3_LabRoom_KNP02,"Guys! You did it! The electricity
is back on!", 
G3_LabRoom_Painky13_2,"The pixelated graphics and
low-fidelity sounds remind me of
my childhood for some reason...  And the Paint Star is definitely in
there. But how do WE get in there?", 
G3_RedRescue01,"Mario! It's really you!  I thought I saw you earlier, but I'm
pretty sure I was hallucinating.
You were all blocky and weird.  Anyway, I chased the green Mini
Paint Star in here, but that
Boomerang Bro was hot on my tail.  Let's get back to the real world
ASAP! I'm going on ahead to the
flagpole. See you there!", 
G3_LabOutside_Painky04,"I was right about the lightning...", 
G3_RedRescue04,"Ah, there you are.
Come on—let's get out of here.", 
G3_LabOutside_Painky07,"Mario! HELP!", 
G3_RedRescue05,"You're going back?
OK, I'll just wait here.", 
G3_RedRescue06,"So glad to be back in the paper
world. Being in that monitor really
freaked me out.", 
G3_RedRescue07,"Let's touch the goal pole and head
back to the flat paper world!", 
G3_LabRoomIn_Painky03_1,"Wait...what did you say about
losing power? Did something
trip a breaker?", 
G3_LabRoomIn_KNP03_2,"It blasted through the window and
went INTO this monitor somehow.  After that, the breaker tripped
and everything went dark.", 
G3_LabRoomIn_KNP01,"Oh, ho, ho! Death Claw?
Not to worry.
That's just a Science Claw, friend!  I apologize for the grabby
introduction, but this is the
Green Energy Plant.  I normally research alternative
sources of renewable energy here,
but ironically the power is out...", 
G3_LabRoomIn_KNP02,"No power? Oh, at first glance I
thought for sure you were some
sort of robot.  Well, I thought you were either a
robot...Ĭor a can of cat food. Either
way...Ĭit was a big win for me.  Anyway, I used my last bit of power
to grab you with this claw.", 
G3_LabRoomIn_KNP03,"Yes, that's exactly what happened!
Only I haven't been able to reset
it like usual.  It was so strange. I saw something
that appeared to be a shooting
star...", 
G3_LabRoomIn_KNP04,"It would be fantastic if you could
fix the power for me. My research
awaits!  And...to be honest...I want to play
with my Science Claw.", 
G3_LabRoomIn_KNP05,"That's the monitor I'm studying right
now. I want to continue my research
as soon as possible!", 
G3_DotStart_Painky01_2,"Heh. Some things never change. Here
we are, inside a crazy pixelated
world, and there's a Goomba!  Try stomping on it or smashing it
with your hammer—like you would in
the real world!", 
G3_LabRoomIn_Painky00,"Locked, eh? Ĭ
Let's try knocking.", 
G3_LabRoomIn_Painky01,"Mario! Help me! This...Ǵthis DEATH
CLAW just grabbed me out of
nowhere!", 
G3_LabRoomIn_Painky02,"And now what? You're trying to
steal the power from my body
with this claw?  Well, I'll never give up my power.
NEVER! ̠Wait, I don't think I even
have any power...",
