Y3_MeetWanwan_Prof01,"What ever are you talking about?
That was my beloved Princess!", 
Y3_MeetWanwan_Prof02,"Mario, thank you for reuniting me
with my sweet little girl.  I suppose she's outgrown her little
house here, but I'm glad she was
able to visit one last time.  If you come across any more bones,
please share with her. She deserves
a treat every now and then.  And let her know that, wherever
she ends up...I'll be thinking of her.", 
Y3_Sad_Painky01,"Professor, pull yourself together!
I'm sure she'll turn up.", 
Y3_MeetWanwan_Prof03,"Oh, and I've got a little something
for you, as a small thank-you for
helping me out. Follow me!", 
Y3_Sad_Prof01,"My sweet, little baby...  She's gone forever! *sob*", 
Y3_Sad_Prof02,"...So you'll help me find her, then!  Thank you for putting your little
Paint Star quest on the back burner
while you find my Princess!  You'll need this permit to access my
dig site. I don't imagine my Princess
is there, but you never know.  Come back to me, my darling... *sob*", 
Y3_Office_Pic01,"D'awwwwwww! That tickles!", 
Y3_Sad_Prof03,"Go on—wallop me.
It matters not...
*sob*", 
Y3_Office_Pic02,"Too cute!", 
Y3_Office_Pic03,"Learning her first trick!", 
Y3_Office3_Assistant01,"We're all relieved that the professor
is back to his usual self. Thank you
for your help, Mario!", 
Y3_Garden_kinopio01,"This is...ʼBaby Princess's Cuddle
Palace. *sigh*  The professor insists that I call it
that. He's docked my pay for
not saying it!", 
Y3_Garden_kinopio02,"The professor has decided to lie
facedown on the ground for a
little while to process his emotions.  If you feel like helping out, maybe
you could find Princess's favorite
snack. It could help lure her back
here.", 
Y3_Garden_kinopio03,"I'm so glad the professor is back to
his normal, super-old self.  Thanks for everything, Mario.", 
Y3_Toge_Painky01,"How does he get any work done
with this giant spike on his desk?", 
Y3_Office_Board01,"Excavation Report:
  Giant bone discovered in
  Marmalade Valley!", 
Y3_Office4_Prof01,"Ah, my dear Mario. I hear you were
witness to a rather magnificent
event at my dig site!  Yes, it appears that the Big Paint
Star somehow revitalized our
Draggadon fossil with paint.  Which means, of course, that it
was never really a fossil to begin
with! It was merely de-colorized.  Anyhow, if you wish to study that
fascinating creature in more detail,
you ought to track it to its home.  In that regard, I may be of some
assistance. Draggadons are known
for nesting deep within volcanoes.
They just love the heat!  Good luck, Mario. And thank you.", 
Y3_Office_Board02,"Excavation Report:
  Monster rampaged through dig
  site; fossil surprisingly unharmed!", 
Y3_Office4_Prof02,"Draggadons are known for nesting
deep within volcanoes. Do be careful
if you track our little Draggadon
to its lair, OK?", 
Y3_Office_Board03,"Excavation Report
  Major fossil stolen during cave-in
  by unknown miscreants!", 
Y3_Office_Board05,"Excavation Report
  Based on skull shape, Draggadon
  likely vulnerable on top of head.", 
Y3_Office_Board06,"Excavation Report
  Fossil determined to be giant ancient
  creature! Let's name it ""Draggadon.""", 
Y3_Office1_Painky01,"I'm not sure. I think maybe we need
to talk to the professor. See, we're
looking for missing Paint Stars, and...  It's kind of a long story, but we can
see one of them from the professor's
front yard.", 
Y3_Entrance01,"This is the professor's house.", 
Y3_Entrance02,"The professor studies fossils and
other really old things. He's what's
known as an ""old rock"" in the
parlance of his field.", 
Y3_Office3_Prof01,"Ah, yes.̠ Now, where were we?̠
Of course...I was about to give you
a small reward.", 
Y3_Office2_Assistant01,"Oh, hello, Mario!  The professor is back, and he
seems happy!  Funny though... I don't think I saw
Princess with him...", 
Y3_Office3_Prof02,"So, how do you like my gift so far?
Have you accidentally stabbed
yourself yet? Oh, ho! ʼDo be careful.", 
Y3_Office1_Assistant01,"Welcome back, Professor! I've
arranged your blue boxes just
the way you like th—   Oh! You're not the professor.
Can I help you?", 
Y3_Office3_Prof03,"A fellow at the dig site was about to
throw this out, but I thought it might
be of interest to you.  Be careful now! It's as sharp
as...̠erm...̠something very, very
sharp.  You'll have to pardon the analogy.
I'm a paleo-archeologist, not one
of those...̠um...̠good-talking guys.  Ah! I've got it. It's as sharp as the
spine on a Spiny. Yes, that will do.", 
Y3_Office1_Assistant02,"Hmm...are the Paint Stars extremely
old? Because the professor is mostly
interested in very old things.  You know... Fossils...ruins...
Stuff like that.  Well, and his Princess. He's definitely
obsessed with his Princess.  That reminds me—the professor is on
a walk in Mondo Woods with
Princess...but he's been gone so long!  I'm actually getting a little worried.
Should I do something?
Organize a search party?  No...my first instinct was correct.
I'll just wait passively in the corner
and hope for the best.", 
Y3_Office2_Assistant03,"The professor came back in a really
good mood, but now...", 
Y3_Office1_Assistant03,"All I know is that the professor took
Princess for a walk in Mondo Woods...
and he hasn't come back.  He's never gone for this long. I'm
starting to get worried!", 
Y3_MeetWanwan_Kinopio01,"Oh, no! The professor was crushed
by this giant...thing! Now he's going
to be in an even WORSE mood!",
