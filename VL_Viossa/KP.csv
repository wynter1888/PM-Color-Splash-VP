KP_RecoveryHall_Painky01_2,"Actually...Ɛ
I really need to get this off my chest.", 
KP_Battle_Boss_30,"This isn't working, Mario! No matter
how much damage he takes, the
black paint keeps rejuvenating him.  I...I think we just need to get all
of that paint OFF him somehow.  I have an idea...but I'll need to
return to my original form. From
before you wrung me out—remember?", 
KP_RecoveryHall_Painky01_3,"I feel like we've gotten to know
each other pretty well, Mario.  Ever since that day when you
woke me up by crushing my face
with a hammer.  We've had some laughs, we've had
some hard times...̠we've had
some mild electrocution.  But through it all, you've never given
up on me—or on finding all of Prism
Island's precious Paint Stars.", 
KP_Battle_Boss_31,"I'm going to turn myself into a card.
And then you need to paint me!  It's, like, the opposite of wringing
me out. ʼOr something.ʼ
Trust me—it'll work.", 
KP_RecoveryHall_Painky01_4,"So I guess I just want to say...̠
thank you.  No matter what happens next,
I will always be grateful for your
friendship.", 
KP_RecoveryHall_Painky01_5,"Well, there's just one thing left to
do. Let's go stop Bowser and save
Princess Peach!  OK, you're right. That's two things.", 
KP_RecoveryHall_Painky01,"Before we go any further, there's
something I need to tell you, Mario.", 
KP_AfterBattle_Koopa01,"Wha...? What's going on?  MARIO?! What are YOU doing here?̠
Do we have a kart race scheduled
for today?  WHAT DID YOU DO TO MY BRAIN,
CHUMPS?!  And why do I feel like I just got
hit by a bus?!", 
KP_Battle_Boss_Roy_11,"Here comes your paint, buddy.̠
I told you I'd give it back to you.", 
KP_RecoveryHall_Painky03,"You know...Ɛnever mind.Ɛ
Now's not the time.Ɛ
Let's keep moving...",

 We beat Bowser!", 
KP_Battle_Boss_Roy_12,"Buckle up, buttercup!", 
KP_Battle_Boss_Roy_13,"Oh, but I almost forgot. We gotta
do one more thing before I give
back the paint.", 
KP_Battle_Boss_Roy_14,"All right! Now we're ready to
rock and roll!", 
KP_FrontGate_Painky01,"Thanks, Luigi. If anyone gives you
any trouble, just give 'em that
mean stare you showed us earlier.", 
KP_FrontGate_Painky02,"All right, Mario. Let's go rescue
Princess Peach!", 
KP_LastBattle_Painky01,"It's over, Bowser! We already
destroyed your bomb factory!  Surrender now, and we'll draw a
nice bubble bath so you can wash
that gunk off!", 
KP_Battle_Boss_50,"Mario, all of this black paint is
starting to get to me. I don't
know how much more I can take...  Please...try your best to block
those attacks...", 
KP_Conv_Painky05_2,"Wait. You want ME to pretend to
be a common bucket?  Well...if it will help save paint...I
guess I can give it a try.", 
KP_Battle_Boss_51,"URRRRRRRRGH...  This is bad. I don't know how many
more hits I can take...  Mario, if you've got anything else
up your sleeve, now's the time
to pull it out!  Do as much damage as you can
so we can get the rest of his
black paint!", 
KP_Escape_Peach01,"Mario! Time is running out! Get
on the kart!", 
KP_Battle_Boss_52," It's no good!
 My body can't take any more!", 
KP_Escape_Peach02,"OK, Mario and Huey...your turn!", 
KP_Escape_Painky00,"Go on, Mario.
Get in the kart!", 
KP_PaintWave_Painky01,"Whew! That was close!
I never want to see another drop
of black paint as long as I live!", 
KP_Escape_Peach03,"Your turn, Huey!
Come on!", 
KP_Escape_Painky01,"No...ʼ I'm afraid I can't.", 
KP_Escape_Painky02,"When this castle collapses, all of
that black paint is going to fall
out and land somewhere.  I can't let that happen.  I'm a guardian, created to protect
the Prisma Fountain in times
of crisis.  It took me a while to realize it, but
my purpose is not to recover the
Paint Stars.  It's to destroy the black paint.", 
KP_Escape_Painky03,"The road is about to collapse!
You need to leave NOW!", 
KP_Escape_Painky04,"All right.
*sigh*", 
KP_Escape_Painky05,"I'll be right behind you. ̠I promise.̠
I can fly—remember? I just need to
take care of this mess first.  I'll see you all at Prisma Fountain!", 
KP_Escape_Painky06,"Here goes nothing...
Big Paint Stars, grant me
the power to SQUEEZE!", 
KP_Battle_Boss_40x,"NO! I couldn't absorb that last
attack, and a bunch of the black
paint returned to Bowser!  We're going to get that black paint
back. Stay focused on blocking his
attacks!", 
KP_Battle_Boss_50_2,"Mario, the damage from blocking
these attacks is starting to get
to me...  But I noticed that when we deal 
damage to Bowser, black paint starts
to pool around his feet.  Once a lot of black paint builds up
around his feet, he launches
more-powerful attacks, giving us a
chance to collect a bunch of paint!  But those powerful attacks
are harder to block.
The stakes are high!  Try to collect as much black paint
as you can every time you block an
attack!", 
KP_AfterBattle_Painky01_1,"That's not good.
Black paint incoming!", 
KP_Escape_Painky07,"The road is detaching from the
castle! Hurry!", 
KP_Battle_Boss_02,"   Running won't get you anywhere!
This doesn't end until one of us
drops. ̠Most likely you!", 
KP_RainbowRoad_Luigi01,"Well, it sounds like you've been on
quite an adventure without me, Bro!  But at least I can help you out 
a little a-bit with the driving.
Princess-a Peach-a, here we come!", 
KP_FrontGate_Luigi00,"
   Black Bowser's Castle!", 
KP_AfterBattle_Painky01_2,"I don't think this castle's going to
last much longer. Let's get the
princess and get out of here!", 
KP_Escape_Painky08,"What are you waiting for?!
GO GO!", 
KP_RainbowRoad_Luigi02,"We're getting a-close...Ǵto something.", 
KP_FrontGate_Luigi01,"Phew! We made it.  You guys be a-careful in there, OK?Ǵ
I'll...̠I'll just wait here. ǴYou know.Ǵ
In case you need a ride back.", 
KP_AfterBattle_Painky01_3,"GO GO GO!", 
KP_Escape_Painky09,"I hate lying to them...", 
KP_RainbowRoad_Luigi03,"MAMMA MIA!̠ It leads to a giant
creepy rock in the sky!  But we can't stop a-now! You guys
have worked way too hard for
me to chicken out here!  Hold on! I'm-a gonna floor it!
Hopefully we don't fly off the road.
Lakitu's not a-here to save us!", 
KP_FrontGate_Luigi02,"Do you need a ride back to
Port Prisma?   Ĭ
yesno", 
KP_FrontGate_Luigi03,"OK, hop in!", 
KP_FrontGate_Luigi04,"OK. I'll just keep waiting out here...", 
KP_Battle_Boss_20,"Thanks, Mario.  I feel kind of...heavy...but I also
feel strong!  So, here's the plan. You need to
use me as a shield to block Bowser's
black-paint attacks.  Don't worry about me. I feel
stronger than ever right now!  I should be able to steal a little
paint from him every time you
block an attack.  You got that? Focus on blocking
his attacks by pressing  at just
the right time.  LET'S ƐDOƐ THIS.", 
KP_Conv_Painky,"Wait. You want ME to pretend to
be a common bucket?  Well...if it will help save paint...I
guess I can give it a try.", 
KP_Battle_Boss_21,"GRAAAH!̠ It worked!̠
I absorbed the black paint!  But, man... That was more painful
than I thought it would be.  I can only withstand about 10 more
of those attacks, so make each and
every one count.", 
KP_AfterBattle_Painky01,"Oh, right! The princess.
Let's repaint her right away!", 
KP_AfterBattle_Painky02,"Mario, this is no time to go exploring!
Hurry up and save Princess Peach
before this place collapses!", 
KP_KillerHangar_Painky01,"It worked!
So much for Bowser's bomb factory...", 
KP_AfterBattle_Painky03,"We can talk later, Princess!
We need to get out of here now!", 
KP_KillerHangar_Painky02,"But all the black paint from the
tank is flooding the room!
HOW IS THERE SO MUCH?!  It's rising! Don't let it touch you!", 
KP_Battle_Boss_Roy_01,"Thanks for the paint, old man!
Bahaha!  Don't worry—you'll get it back soon
enough...", 
KP_AfterBattle_Painky05,"  NO! All of that work...for nothing!", 
KP_Battle_Boss_Roy_02,"Bahaha! Check it out—I'm gonna
splat you with your own paint.
How's that for irony?  Yeah, I know what irony is. BOOM. 
Knowledge is power, so I started
going to night school.", 
KP_AfterBattle_Peach02_2,"Understood.
But you look terrible!
At least let me fix you up first.", 
KP_AfterBattle_Painky06,"Mario, keep going! This place won't
last much longer!", 
KP_Battle_Boss_Roy_03,"Bah! This is too slow.  Hey, guys, just bring me all of
the paint at once!", 
KP_AfterBattle_Painky07,"We did it, Mario...", 
KP_Battle_Boss_Roy_04,"There we go! Ooh, that's mixing
up real nice...  Get ready for a blackout!", 
KP_PaintPlant_Painky01,"  
 THAT POOR PAINT!  They're mixing all the beautiful
colors together without any regard
for chromaticity!    Sorry.Ǵ I...ǴI just really like paint.  How do we fix this?!", 
KP_AfterBattle_Painky08,"Mario, what part of ""the castle is
literally falling on us"" do you not
understand?! Let's GO!", 
KP_Battle_Boss_Roy_05,"Bahahah! What are you even
doing? Can you even see where
you're aiming?  What am I saying? Of course
you can't!", 
KP_PaintPlant_Painky02,"Hey, Mario! I have an idea...", 
KP_AfterBattle_Painky09,"We're almost out. Keep moving!", 
KP_Battle_Boss_Roy_06,"Hey, that was pretty close...  ...Close to being the worst shot
I've ever seen! Bahahah!", 
KP_BOSS1st_Painky01,"Mario, we can't do anything with
this black paint all over the place.  Think! Do we have anything that
could wash all of the paint away?  Some kind of ""machine"" that was
designed specifically for ""washing""?", 
KP_PaintPlant_Painky03,"The question is...how do we blow up
the giant Bob-ombs?  Do you think a small Bob-omb is
powerful enough to ignite a
huge one?", 
KP_Battle_Boss_Roy_07,"I'll give you this much—you're
sure trying.  Why don't you come work for me,
kid? We'll call this water under
the bridge. A clean start. Eh?", 
KP_Battle_Boss_Roy_08,"Aw MAN! You figured it out!
No matter. I'll just have to stomp
you the old-fashioned way!", 
KP_Battle_Boss_Roy_09,"No more Mr. Nice Roy!", 
KP_Mayim_ROY02,"Back for more, eh? Bahaha!
Bring it on!", 
KP_Mayim_ROY03,"Gwaaah! How'd you DO that?  I took all your paint, and you didn't
even flinch! You weren't even afraid
of the black paint!  You may have defeated me, but
Lord Bowser won't fall so easily!  Nap time!", 
KP_Escape_Luigi02,"Mario! Peach! Huey!  I wasn't sure you guys were a-gonna
make it!  Get on the kart!
We're a-getting out of here!", 
KP_WhitePeach_Painky02,"  
 Look! It's Princess Peach!", 
KP_Escape_Luigi03,"Peach, you're first. Hurry!", 
KP_BOSS1st_Painky08,"What are you doing? Mixing all of
the paint like that is just going to
make a bunch of black paint! ҰOh.", 
KP_Battle_Boss_40,"We did it! We stole all the black paint
from Bowser!  Bowser's at his weakest...Ǵ
Now's the time to hit him with
our most powerful attack!", 
KP_WhitePeach_Painky03,"They've drained her color and
framed her like some kind of
pretentious art!", 
KP_Battle_Boss_41,"Wait, you're out of offensive Battle
Cards? Like...OUT OUT? But we're so
close to winning this thing!  Here. I stashed one away for an
emergency like this. I hope you
can put it to good use!", 
KP_Escape_Luigi05,"I think he's a-right, Bro.
Trust me—I've fallen off Rainbow
Road more times than I can count.  It's a-now or never!", 
KP_WhitePeach_Painky05,"YAHAAAAA! WE'RE ALIVE!̠
But now Princess Peach is gone...  I'm beginning to understand why
you've been fighting this Bowser guy
for 30 years.", 
KP_Conv_Painky01,"What is going on here? This is the
creepiest thing I've ever seen!", 
KP_Conv_Painky02,"Look at those huge buckets! Just
like the ones that were attached
to those airships...  So this is where they've been
bringing all of the paint they
stole from Prism Island. But why?", 
KP_PaintPlant_Painky02_2,"See those giant Bob-ombs over
there? What if we blew them up?  I bet they'd be strong enough to
destroy the black-paint tank!̠
Plus it'll be REALLY fun.", 
KP_Conv_Painky03,"And why are they taking the paint
into that tunnel?   Just what is Bowser planning?", 
KP_ProductionLine_Painky00,"  
 He's making black paint bombs!  Those are just like the one that
fell on Sunglow Ridge. Do you
remember that horrible mess?  With this many bombs, he could...ʼ
Why...Ǵhe could paint the whole
world black!", 
KP_Conv_Painky04,"Man! How are we gonna get past
this guy without a bucket?  Think! Is there anything around here
that could pass for a bucket?", 
KP_ProductionLine_Painky01,"It looks like they're pumping in all
of the black paint from that room
over there.  We HAVE to put a stop to this!", 
KP_Conv_Painky05,"Nice try, Mario, but I'm not a bucket.
And frankly, I'm a little bit insulted.", 
KP_Conv_Painky06,"Don't tell anyone that I pretended
to be a bucket, OK?", 
KP_PaintPlant_Bros03,"Intruder alert!  Wait a second...Ǵ That's no ordinary
intruder. ǴThat's Mario!", 
KP_Battle_Boss_60,"This is no time to play dress-up!
You need to use me to block attacks!", 
KP_PaintPlant_Bros04,"We've made soooo many Bob-ombs
already today...  Whaddaya say we play hooky this
afternoon? Maybe toss the ol'
boomerang a little?", 
KP_Battle_Boss_61,"This is no time for a photoshoot!
You need to use me to block attacks!", 
KP_Escape_Painky10,"But it's the only way!", 
KP_Battle_Boss_10,"Huh? ̠Mario?!̠
What are you doing in my castle,
chump?!  Is...ʼis Princess Peach with you?", 
KP_Battle_Boss_21x_2,"Mario, this isn't working!  I know it's hard, but try to focus
on your timing. We've got to block
more of his attacks!  It seems like the more we hurt him,
the more black paint pools up
around his feet.  And the more black paint he has
around his feet, the stronger his
attacks become!  It's a risky game, but if we can steal
that paint by blocking his attacks,
we can still win this thing.", 
KP_Battle_Boss_12,"   GRAAAAAAAAARH!
IGNORE THE WORDS I JUST SAID.  SUFFER THE TRUE POWER
OF BLACK PAINT!", 
KP_Conv_HEI01,"I lost my bucket. That's why I'm
hiding here.  It's not a good plan, but it's the
only one I've got...", 
KP_Battle_Boss_13,"   YOU DARE STEAL THE BLACK PAINT?!  LET'S SEE YOU BLOCK...THIS!", 
KP_Mayim_Painky00_2,"But at least we're not surrounded
by bad guys!", 
KP_Battle_Boss_Roy_Sample,"A Replica? You expect to beat ME
with a REPLICA?! Bahaha!
Take that weak stuff back to
the Mushroom Kingdom.", 
KP_Battle_Boss_15,"   ARGH! THAT'S IT!  PREPARE TO FACE...ǴMY LAST BREATH!", 
KP_PaintPlant_Bros04_01,"It's always gotta be the boomerang.
Why can't we ever toss the ol'
hammer around?  Oh...right.", 
KP_Battle_Boss_16,"   OK, NOW THIS IS *REALLY* MY
LAST BREATH. THE OTHER ONE
WAS A WARM-UP!", 
KP_PaintPlant_Bros04_02,"AHHHHHH!̠
Oh, it's just Mario. ̠Whew!   For a second I thought Bowser
caught us slacking off.", 
KP_PaintPlant_Bros04_03,"Let's make sure Mario can't tell
the boss on us.  C'mon, fam! We'll knock off Mario,
and then knock off early!", 
KP_Battle_Boss_21x,"I know we can do this, Mario!
Just block his attacks so I can
steal Bowser's black paint!", 
KP_Mayim_Painky00,"OK, Bowser got us with that one.", 
KP_Mayim_Painky01,"The nerve of that guy! You NEVER
use a man's own paint against him!
There are treaties against that!  Anyway, Princess Peach is still up
there. Let's go save her!", 
KP_Conv_NOK01,"No bucket? ̠No tunnel!", 
KP_LastBattle_Koopa01,"   Well, well, well.ɘ Mario!ɘ
I must admit—I didn't think you'd
make it this far.", 
KP_LastBattle_Koopa02,"   BWAHAHA!
Put a lid on it, Rusty!  I'll show you the true
meaning of PAINҰT!", 
KP_LastBattle_Koopa04,"   Your beloved Princess Peach is here
too! I knew she wouldn't want to
miss this.  Of course, I couldn't have her
sending out those pesky little
letters behind my back...  You know what she said when I
caught her spying on me?̠
""I've been framed!""̠ BAHAHAHA!",

Huey!
Oh, thank goodness!",
