R3_DragonBye_Painky01,"DRAGGADON! THANK YOU FOR THE
RIDE. PLEASE ENJOY YOUR TASTY
BURGER. WE LOVE YOU. BYE.", 
R3_RescueWatch_Painky02,"Look—a Paint Star!  Aww, it's awfully far away, isn't it?
How are we gonna get it?", 
R3_DragonEscape_Painky04_2,"Luckily, I speak a little Draggadon!̠
But I haven't used it since college.
Ahem... ", 
R3_MagmaBurgerNothing_Painky01,"Hey, I don't think that's going to
work without any bait. Why don't
you get another Magma Burger from
Fort Cobalt and try again?", 
R3_DragonEscape_Painky04_3,"HEY! DRAGGADON! I AM HUEY.
THIS IS MARIO. WE ARE FRIENDS.  HOW ARE YOU DOING?
SURE IS HOT IN HERE, RIGHT?", 
R3_MagmaBurgerNothing_Painky02,"Hey, I don't think that's going to
work without any bait. Why don't
you get another Magma Burger from
Fort Cobalt and try again?", 
R3_Coach_MUC02_2,"Oh man...
I'll never stop Mario at this rate.", 
R3_Coach_MUC01,"All right, Fire Bros.
Aim true and fire when ready.
Just like we practiced!", 
R3_DragonRoom_Painky01,"It certainly is an impressive sight...
Seems like something could pop out
at us at any moment.  But for the time being, it doesn't
look like anything's gonna happen
here.  And it's not like we can walk
across hot lava. Let's head
back for now.", 
R3_Coach_MUC02,"No! My specially trained Fire Bros.!
What have you done to them?!", 
R3_Coach_MUC03,"You fool! You haven't properly
warmed up your shoulder!", 
R3_Coach_MUC04,"What was that? Throw your
fastball, man! Not this off-speed
nonsense!", 
R3_Coach_MUC05,"Man, would it kill Bowser to recruit
just ONE minion with a decent
throwing arm?", 
R3_Coach_MUC06,"Well, so much for that team. Now
I've got to start from scratch...", 
R3_MagmaWhite_Painky01,"Whoa, Draggadon sighting! Guess he
didn't like it in here, though.  I wonder what it is about this room
that bothers him...", 
R3_RedRescue40_01,"HELP! Somebody help me!", 
R3_DragonRide_Painky02,"Whoa! He's really out of it!  Like...he's not moving at all.
Hmm...  You know, if we could find something
to lead him, maybe we could, like,
RIDE him around!  Wait...don't you have some food on
you? Why don't you see if it smells
good to the Draggadon?", 
R3_RedRescue40_02,"Whoa, Mario? Riding Draggadon?
This is too much!  I mean, first I fell into a volcano,
which was super scary. And then
I'm pretty sure Draggadon ate me.  Anyway...it seems I was not actually
eaten. Unless this is a fever dream!
Or the afterlife...  Either way, I have a lot to think 
about. Would you mind giving me
a ride out of this place?", 
R3_DragonRide_Painky03,"Yes! Looks like we've snagged
ourselves a pet Draggadon!  Man, he's really focused on that
Magma Burger. I bet he'd take us
anywhere right now.", 
R3_RedRescue40_03,"Oh, please don't leave me here!
Another Draggadon might come
along and eat me!", 
R3_DragonRide_Painky04,"Heh! Just as I thought. We could
stand on his head all day!  Now, if only we had something to
lead him, we'd really be in business.
I wonder what kind of food he eats...", 
R3_RedRescue40_04,"What a day. Nearly eaten by
Draggadon, and then RESCUED by
the same Draggadon!  AND I met Mario. I'll be telling my
grandkids about this day for sure!", 
R3_DragonRide_Painky05,"Heh! Just as I thought.
We could stand on his head all day!  Now, if only we had something to
lead him, we'd really be in business.
I wonder what kind of food he eats...  Wait! Don't you have something
tasty in your inventory? Why don't
you see if he's interested?", 
R3_BurgerSelect_Painky01,"What a way to travel. That was
exhilarating! And look...a Mini
Paint Star!  All right, why don't you give the
poor guy his Magma Burger?
He's done enough for us today.   Ĭ
yesno", 
R3_BurgerSelect_Painky02,"We can always buy another one, and
he DID get us to the Paint Star, so
let's give Draggadon the Magma
Burger as a sign of our appreciation.   Ĭ
yesno", 
R3_BurgerSelect_Painky03,"Oh, you want to keep riding?
Sounds good to me. Wheee!", 
R3_DragonEscape_Painky02,"Oof. That had to hurt.  We were just trying to calm him
down...but now I feel guilty.", 
R3_DragonEscape_Painky04,"DA-ĬDA-ĬDA-ĬDA-ĬDA-ĬDA...   DRAGGADON! d", 
R3_DragonEscape_Painky05,"I think that's bad...", 
R3_Temae_MUC01,"He's right in front of us.", 
R3_Temae_MUC02,"Right. Let's try throwing it again!", 
R3_Temae_MUC03,"Um, I said in front of us. In FRONT
of us. Like, right in front of us!", 
R3_Temae_MUC04,"Right in front of us!", 
R3_TalkEnemy_MUC01,"Hey, this is MY cool corner. It's the
only place that's kinda sheltered
from the face-melting heat out
there. So bug off!", 
R3_TalkEnemy_MUC02,"There's, like, no blue paint in this
entire volcano! How are we gonna
make our quota?", 
R3_DragonRide_Painky01_1,"Wow. He's really out of it!  Like...he's not moving at all.
Hmm...  You know, if we could find something
to tempt him, maybe we could, like,
RIDE him around!  Like...I don't know...some really
delicious food or something?
What would a Draggadon eat?  I don't have any other ideas.
Oh...wait! Did you happen to bring a
lava-proof swimsuit?  Yeah, me either...", 
R3_Coach_MUC01_1,"All right, Fire Bro.
Aim true and fire when ready.
Just like we practiced!", 
R3_IceBros01,"Coach! Put me in, coach!", 
R3_IceBros02,"C'mon, coach! Gimme a chance!", 
R3_UpDown_Painky01,"Whoo-ee! It sure is hot inside this
volcano. Good thing I don't have
any sweat glands.  This probably goes without saying,
but try not to fall into the lava, OK?", 
R3_YellowRescue11_01,"Ah, look at this view. So invigorating!Ǵ
And terrifying. ǴMostly terrifying.  No matter! I feel inspired! Starting
tomorrow, I shall redouble my
rescuing efforts!  In the meantime, I'll just eat
something REALLY spicy as
a display of bravery.", 
R3_MagmaPond_Painky01,"I don't think Draggadon is that tall...", 
R3_TalkEnemy_MUC02_2,"Sounds like the quotas are going up,
too. I hear we're gonna be making
more of those black paint bombs...",
