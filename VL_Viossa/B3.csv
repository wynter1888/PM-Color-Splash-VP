Room 201!
How did I miss that?!", 
B3_LookForPot_Front01,"Huh? A teapot?
With purple flowers on it?  I feel like I've seen one recently.
Hold on!", 
B3_2F_GKNKP03,"Thanks to you I was finally able to
check in!  But I've got a tea party to get to,
so I've gotta jet. Ta-ta!", 
B3_LookForPot_Front02,"Nope. Sorry. We don't have
a purple flower teapot here.  But I'm pretty sure I saw one in Plum
Park—that's the garden behind the
hotel.  Sorry I couldn't be of much help.
But hopefully this Mini Paint Star
will raise your spirits.",

B3_LobbyIntro_Manager01,"Oh, of course the world-famous
VIP shows up now...   Look, I wish I could take your coin,
Mario, but the hotel is closed...̠
indefinitely.   You see, we've had some bizarre...̠
occurrences here as of late.   We're really in no state to welcome
guests.", 
B3_LobbyIntro_Manager02,"See?
There's a strange force at work here.  I called Luigi because paranormal
activity is kind of his thing, but it
went straight to voice mail.   Do you think you could poke around
and find what's causing all of this?
I beg of you!", 
B3_LobbyIntro_Manager03,"The hotel is currently closed.
There are no guests staying with us
at the moment.  All of the rooms are empty, but we
have staff on hand so we can reopen
the moment we solve our...problem.", 
B3_Library_GKNP01,"Argh! Where did that book go?!
I've been tearing this place
apart trying to find it.  For some reason this book here is
way heavier than the others,
and I can't seem to move it!", 
B3_Library_GKNP02,"YEAH! This is the book!
Thanks so much!  Now that I have my book,
the meeting should go great!
I'd better get to work!", 
B3_OutSide_KNP1_01_2,"Not a single red bird has shown up.
Must've just been a rumor.", 
B3_301_Painky01,"Whoa! Stuff flying around by itself!
That HAS to be some sort of
paranormal phenomenon!", 
B3_Library_GKNP01_2,"I can't find that book!
It doesn't seem to be this super-
heavy one either.  It was definitely on this bookshelf
before! Someone must have borrowed
it and not brought it back!", 
B3_301_Painky02,"Cool it.
We brought you some fresh sheets.", 
B3_SheetGhost_Front02_1,"It won't be long before I get another
call from 301.  It comes at the same time every day.", 
B3_301_Painky03,"OK, so this has got to be some sort
of paranormal mess.", 
B3_LobbyIntro_Painky01_2,"Of course!
This is paranormal activity too!  This hotel is stuck in some sort of
time loop! We're playing the same
hours over and over again!  Just now, like when we came here
for the first time, the clock struck
12, and then the phone rang.  Unless we stop the source of the
paranormal activity, this hotel is
doomed to live the same hours over
and over again. For all eternity!  And if there IS a Paint Star here,
we'll never find it in that case!
So let's put our detective hats on
and solve the mystery!", 
B3_302_KNKP04_2,"AHHHHHHH!
A ghost with a creepy mustache!  Oh, it's just Mario.
Sorry about that...  Hey, uh, you're not gonna tell
anyone I'm slacking off in here,
are you?", 
B3_DiningRoom_Manager01,"I'm glad you're here, Mario.  These guests rented this room for a
tea party, but their teapot has gone
missing!  Could you ask at the front desk
if they've seen it around? It has a
purple floral pattern on it.", 
B3_301_GKNKP01,"Hello? HELLO?
Can't you hear me?
Why don't you answer?!  FINE. Whatever!
The service in this hotel stinks!", 
B3_DiningRoom_GKNP03_01,"Wow, this place looks really different
now that I can actually see it!", 
B3_DiningRoom_Manager02,"Could you ask at the front desk if
they've come across a teapot with
a purple flower pattern on it?", 
B3_301_GKNKP02,"My bedsheets are all wrinkly and
creased, so I keep calling the front
desk to have them changed.  But they never seem to answer!
It's like they can't even hear
my voice!  Makes me wanna tear this whole
room up again just to get some
service!", 
B3_DiningRoom_GKNP03_02,"What is the meaning of this?", 
B3_301_GKNKP03,"My bedsheets are wrinkled!
I swear—if they don't change them
out, I'm gonna turn this room upside
down again!  And then I'm gonna give this place
a bad review online!", 
B3_202_GKNKP01,"I can't find them anywhere!", 
B3_301_GKNKP04,"Really? Well, hurry up and change
them before I have a chat with your
manager!", 
B3_LobbyIntro_Painky00,"Mario, did you hear that?
Paranormal activity!
Like ghosts and junk!  We should investigate. I have an
inkling that this has something to
do with the Paint Stars.   And it's not just colorless spots—this
place is creepy as all get-out!  Besides...I've always wanted to be a
paranormal investigator.
Ooh! We should get business cards!", 
B3_202_GKNKP02,"My glasses!
I can see for days!
I'm off to the party.", 
B3_LobbyIntro_Painky01,"Mario, did you hear that?
Paranormal activity!
Like ghosts and junk!   We should investigate. I have an
inkling that this has something to do
with the Paint Stars.  It's not just colorless spots—this
place is creepy as all ge—!  Wait... I just had major déjà vu.", 
B3_301_GKNKP06,"Now, change 'em for the fresh ones!", 
B3_302_KNKP02_1,"This book was completely blank
before, so I couldn't read it. But now
that I can read it, it's actually...̠
really, ̠REALLY boring.", 
B3_LobbyIntro_Painky02,"OK, Mario!
I'm sure we'll figure it out this time!", 
B3_301_GKNKP07,"Thanks a bunch for the sheets.
All I wanted was to slide around on
them for a minute.  I would tip you but you took forever.
Later!", 
B3_302_KNKP02_2,"You know, now that I can actually
read this thing...it's SUPER boring.
I'd rather watch paint dry!", 
B3_AfterPanic_KNP09_2,"Oh, so they were using the bed to
hide that hole. Seems like a safety
hazard to me. When's the last time
this place was inspected?", 
B3_301_GKNKP08,"What?! You can't leave NOW!
Hurry up and change the sheets!", 
B3_302_KNKP02_3,"You might enjoy this book, old-timer.
It's all yours.  Just return it to the first-floor
bookcase when you're done with it.", 
B3_TeaTime_Manager01,"Mr. Mario, thank you so much for
resolving this bizarre conundrum.  I am relieved that our six...spooky
customers were happy in the end.  With that, our hotel will finally open
its doors for business once again.  Please take this as an expression of
our gratitude.", 
B3_AfterPanic_KNP09_3,"I don't want to fall in that hole,
so I'm just gonna stay put until
they fix it.", 
B3_301_GKNKP09,"Ahhhh...̠
So smooth.̠ So soft.", 
B3_TeaTime_Manager02,"Now if you'll excuse me, I've got a lot
to do. You're always welcome here
at the Dark Bloo Inn.", 
B3_AfterPanic_KNP01,"I just started this job a little while
ago. Apparently the person who
worked here before me got a new
job.", 
B3_202_GKNKP01_2,"I can't see anything without them!", 
B3_AfterPanic_KNP02,"Come to think of it, I haven't seen a
single bird on Prism Island.
Closest I've seen is a Swoop.", 
B3_AreBattle_Gang1_01,"Ooh, so this is ""it,"" huh?
A-amazing!", 
B3_LookForPot_Painky01,"Wow! Consider our spirits raised!  OK, Paint Star. Come to papa!  ...Ahhhhh!", 
B3_AfterPanic_KNP03,"There are only six plates laid out on
the long table...
Doesn't make any sense to me.", 
B3_LookForPot_Painky02,"It's 3:01 and time's still moving
forward! The Mini Paint Star's still
here!  We did it! That's another case solved
for the paranormal investigators!
Well, I guess it's our first case.", 
B3_AfterPanic_KNP04,"The painting on that wall is simply
splendid, isn't it? It's called
One Last Cup o' Tea.", 
B3_LookForPot_Painky03,"Wow! Consider our spirits raised!  We've solved the paranormal puzzle
of Dark Bloo Inn! Now let's get that
Mini Paint Star, Mario!", 
B3_AfterPanic_KNP05,"The door to this room is really clean!
It looks like it's brand new.
I wonder how long it's been here for?", 
B3_AfterPanic_KNP07_2,"That thing on top of the table
sure is interesting.", 
B3_AfterPanic_Front01_2,"Please put your feet up and take it
easy.", 
B3_AfterPanic_KNP06,"What's up, Mario?
Did you drop something on the floor?", 
B3_AfterPanic_KNP07_3,"Oh, so that was a real Yoshi!
I thought it was one of those
big stuffed animals!", 
B3_OutSide_KNP1_01,"I heard a rumor that there was a
rare red bird around here, so I put
out some bait...  Haven't seen anything though.
Maybe it's just an urban legend?", 
B3_AfterPanic_Front01_3,"Good morning.
I hope you slept well.", 
B3_AfterPanic_KNP07,"I sense something on top of
that table.", 
B3_AfterPanic_KNP07_4,"Stay strong, Yoshi!", 
B3_Dining_KNP01,"The dining hall is through here,
but the hotel is closed, so there's
no one in there.", 
B3_203_HEI01,"HA! It's mine.
It's all mine!", 
B3_OutSide_KNP1_02,"Bahaha! Gimme a break.
Like any bird is going to willingly
fly into a birdcage!", 
B3_AfterPanic_Front01_4,"Understood. Well, please come back
and rest anytime.", 
B3_AfterPanic_KNP07_5,"This room smells a bit...Yoshi-esque,
don't you think?", 
B3_AfterPanic_KNP08,"Ahhhhh. These are the smoothest,
softest sheets I've ever caressed!", 
B3_Dining_KNP02,"The dining hall is through here.
I did see a rather spooky individual
enter a short while ago.", 
B3_OutSide_KNP1_03,"It's a Koopa Paratroopa!
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!", 
B3_AfterPanic_Front01_5,"Come back again anytime!", 
B3_AfterPanic_KNP09,"Doesn't the bed in here seem like
it's at a strange angle?", 
B3_FirstGhost_Painky01,"WAAAAAAAAH!
The paint revealed a ghostly
presence! No way...", 
B3_Dining_KNP03,"My manager went to deal with a
customer complaint or something,
but he hasn't come out yet.", 
B3_FirstGhost_Painky02,"So even Mario gets scared sometimes.
Don't worry—I won't tell
Princess Peach.", 
B3_OutSide_KNP1_05,"Guess there aren't any red birds
around after all...  And I don't really fancy dealing with
any more Koopa Paratroopas, so
I'm going to find a new hobby.", 
B3_AfterPanic_Manager01,"Thanks to you, Mario, we were able
to open our doors again. Thank you!", 
B3_SheetGhost_Front01,"I got a phone call from room 301,
but I couldn't hear anything on
the other end.  There isn't even anyone in 301
right now. So creepy!", 
B3_SheetGhost_Painky01,"How can the room be calling if
there's no one in it?", 
B3_203_GKNKP01,"No! It's gone!
He stole it!", 
B3_DiningRoom_GKNP05_01,"You changed those sheets like a pro!
Sorry I didn't tip you.",

 (Print Edition)", 
B3_SheetGhost_Front02,"I just got another silent phone call
from room 301.  That's the second time today.
SO CREEPY!", 
B3_SheetGhost_Painky02,"Mario, there's gotta be someone
calling from 301 right now, right?  If we know the timing when the
phone calls come, then maybe we
should investigate 301 at that
exact time!", 
B3_203_GKNKP02,"Ah, yes. 
This is it.
Thank you!  Oh, but look at the time!
I'm going to be late for my tea party!", 
B3_DiningRoom_GKNP05_02,"I NEED MAH TEA!", 
B3_SheetGhost_Front03,"I just got another silent call from 
room 301.  No matter how many times I answer,
it doesn't get any less creepy.", 
B3_SheetGhost_Front04,"The silent phone calls from room
301 finally stopped!  I got so used to them that it's kinda
creepy that they've stopped.", 
B3_303_GKNKP01_2,"My beautiful red bird has 
flown away...  It must've gotten sick of staying in
this hideous color-drained cage...", 
B3_TimeSignal_Painky01,"Huh?
What was that noise just now?", 
B3_303_GKNKP01_3,"Ah, you've fixed my birdcage!
Thanks ever so much.  Perhaps my red bird will come back
home now.  If you see my red bird around, please
try to get it back in this cage.", 
B3_TimeSignal_Painky02,"There's that sound again.
It must be the chime from the
front desk's grandfather clock!", 
B3_303_GKNKP01_4,"Mario, please find my beautiful red
bird!", 
B3_TimeSignal_Painky03,"The chime rang three times, so it
must be three o'clock!", 
B3_303_Painky01,"Uh... Is this the red bird that you
mentioned?", 
B3_TimeSignal_Painky04,"That's the one o'clock bell!  The paranormal activity must have
something to do with the time!", 
B3_TimeSignal_Painky05,"One o'clock.", 
B3_TimeSignal_Painky06,"Two o'clock.", 
B3_TimeSignal_Painky07,"Three o'clock!", 
B3_Cleaner_KNP01,"I'm the housekeeping manager.  I've been doing this job for so long,
I can SENSE when a room needs to
be cleaned.  But I noticed something weird
recently. For some reason, dust
doesn't gather under the bed in
room 302.",

B3_AreBattle_Gang3_01,"HOLD IT!", 
B3_Cleaner_KNP03,"Room 301 is always getting messed

check on him?", 
B3_Stop_Front02,"Mario, did you talk to the
manager?", 
B3_Stop_Front03,"What about that Mini Paint Star?
You're just going to leave it?!̠
HAVE YOU GONE MAD, MAN?!", 
B3_TimeOver_Manager01,"  We didn't make it in time...", 
B3_SheetGhost_Front03_1,"I bet it won't be long before I
get another call from 301.  It comes every day at the same time.",

the coop!",

Thank you!  I'm afraid I've got an appointment
for tea, so I really must be going!",

How does it even get this messy?
I love every grimy minute of it!",

Where'd that spooky Toad come

There goes my job security.",

It happened again.
Another silent phone call.",
