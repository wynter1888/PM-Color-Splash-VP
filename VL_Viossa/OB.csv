OB_Platform_KNP06_3,"Thanks, Mario!", 
OB_Sunset_Painky01,"Mario, please lend me your ear for
just a moment.  Don't you ever wish that you could
escape from the hardships of your
everyday life?  Take us, for example. Out of nowhere
and with no notice, we're ordered to
attack the trainworks. Or attack
the kitchen. No rhyme or reason!  Mario, every obstacle you've
experienced has been the result of
our hard and thankless work.  I hope the guys upstairs realize just
how much we actually do. Maybe
next time, I'll just give them a straw
and tell them to get to work!", 
OB_PassingTrain_KNP07,"Everything's just fine and dandy!  The carriages are hooked to the
engine, and the Sunset Express is
ready for departure!", 
OB_Sunset_Painky02,"I sit here and look out of this window
at the evening sky, worn out at the
end of every day...Ĭwishing that I
could go to some faraway place.  But I understand the reality. I'm in
Bowser's army for life, so I'll just 
have to give up on my dreams...  Mario, I'll probably be ordered to
attack you someday. And it'll be
Bad Guy versus Good Guy.
There's no point in lying to ourselves.", 
OB_PassingTrain_KNP08,"Everything's awful!  The VIP and his friends are wreaking
absolute havoc! Just as we were
about to leave, too!", 
OB_EnemyCoach_RGBN01,"Whenever I see the exhaust funnel
on an engine, I get a weird urge to
stuff something into it.  But if I plugged it, the smoke would
stop coming out and I'd get into
trouble with Mr. Larry...",

OB_Threat_HEI03,"YOU MOVED!", 
OB_Battle_Boss_01,"Ahaaaaaaaaa!
I love the smell of impending doom!  It was my henchmen who hijacked
this train, and it'll be my henchmen
who...Ĭkeep the train, uh...Ǵhijacked.", 
OB_StationStaff3_KNP01,"The rockslide is right over there.
Just follow the tracks.", 
OB_Boss_Painky01,"Giant steak?
So YOU'RE the VIP?!", 
OB_Battle_Boss_02,"Well, well, that's one cheeky Toad!  Why can't he embrace his inner
coward like all his friends?", 
OB_StationStaff3_KNP02,"What kind of VIP...ĬSTEALS A TRAIN?!", 
OB_Battle_Boss_03,"Agh! Stupid Toad!", 
OB_StationStaff3_KNP03,"Mario, we owe you. Big-time.", 
OB_Battle_Boss_04,"You stopped up my smokestack,
ya little pest!", 
OB_StationStaff3_KNP04,"That container was a water tower?!
I bet the view from up there is nice.", 
OB_PassingTrain_EKNP01,"Mario! It's terrible! The VIP hijacked
the engine as soon as they heard
you were heading to Starlight Cape!  But I think we can still catch him in
my lightning-fast...Ǵhandcar!  We'll need you to start us off! Just
hit the handle with your hammer.
ĬHARD!", 
OB_Battle_Boss_KNP_10,"Th-thanks, Mario. Please keep it up!", 
OB_Battle_Boss_05,"If you love engines so much, then
why don't you marry this smoke!", 
OB_StationStaff3_KNP05,"I think I've seen a block with the
same mark that's on this container...
somewhere on the platform.", 
OB_PassingTrain_EKNP02,"We'll need you to start us off! Just
give the handle a hefty WHACK!",

Mario...", 
OB_Battle_Boss_06,"Ahaaaaaaaaaaa! I'm over here!", 
OB_PassingTrain_EKNP03,"Mario?! Are you really hoping to
catch up with the train...on foot?
Let's take the handcar!", 
OB_Battle_Boss_07,"Ahaaaaaaaaaaaaa!", 
OB_PassingTrain_EKNP04,"Mario! Where are you going?
We have to go after the Sunset
Express!", 
OB_TrainStop_KNP01,"Mario!
Your timing is impeccable...̠as always.
Funny how that works.  This is the first stop for the Sunset
Express bound for Starlight Cape!  The engine is about to arrive from
the restaurant, but—", 
OB_Log_HEI01,"HEY!", 
OB_TrainStop_KNP02,"That's what I was about to tell you!  There's been a major rockslide a
little way up the tracks!  But we're not strong enough to clear
the tracks, so we've just been
standing around waving our arms
and blinking rapidly.  Toads aren't really known for being
proactive.", 
OB_Log_HEI02,"We weren't done rolling all the logs!", 
OB_EnemyCoach_HEI01,"We shovel the coal, breathing in
harmful toxins as we're covered in
smoke and ash.  All while Mr. Larry just chills.Ĭ
Typical manager.", 
OB_TrainStop_KNP03,"The rockslide is just a little way up
the tracks. You can't miss it!", 
OB_Platform_KNP10,"The red Rescue Squad group can't
set out unless that rockslide is gone.", 
OB_Log_HEI03,"That's more like it!", 
OB_RedRescue01_01,"Mario! Hi-hi-hi-hi-Ǵhijacked!Ĭ The
Sunset Express has been hijacked!  Rescue Squad members are still inside
the train. If you find them, please
save them!", 
OB_EnemyCoach_HEI02,"Mr. Larry has it good—taking a trip
on a luxury train and getting to eat
delicious hand-hammered meats?  I hope I'm that successful one day!", 
OB_RedRescue34_01,"The engine is just ahead, but we
can't get to it from here.  You might need to walk along the
roof to get on top of the coal car.", 
OB_EnemyCoach_HEI03,"Thanks for listening, Mario. I'm sure
we'll meet again...Ĭmaybe as enemies.", 
OB_RedRescue34_02,"Sorry! I forgot to introduce myself!", 
OB_PassingTrain_KNP10_2,"I don't think I've run that hard since
our half-mushroomathon!", 
OB_Platform_Passenger03,"The whole squad is going on a staff
holiday. You've got to relax from time
to time. Don't forget that!", 
OB_VipDoorR_Painky01,"Must be locked from the inside...", 
OB_Platform_Passenger04,"Looks as if there's trouble afoot, but
it's our day off today.  Guess it's all up to you, Mario!", 
OB_BackStation_Painky01,"Why are we chasing this train on
foot? Let's hop on the handcar!", 
OB_Platform_Passenger05,"Headed to Starlight Cape to look for
a Paint Star? Good luck on your
quest, Mario!", 
OB_Platform_Passenger06,"The Sunset Express departs at dusk.
How romantic is that?", 
OB_PassingTrain_Penky01,"Let's get back to the Sunset Express.  Next stop: Starlight Cape!", 
OB_PassingTrain_Penky02,"Were you planning on walking the
rest of the way?  Come on—let's go back to the
Sunset Express!", 
OB_PassingTrain_Penky03,"Wait, Mario! We have to get that
rock out of the way.", 
OB_Trunk_Painky01,"This trunk is locked.", 
OB_RedRescue40_01,"He was really heavy!", 
OB_Shootingstar_Painky01_1,"No wonder it's called Starlight Cape.", 
OB_Boss_LAR01,"Took you long enough, pal...  I'm almost done digesting that giant
steak I ate.  *BELCH*", 
OB_Boss_EKNP01,"The train is about to pull into
Starlight Cape, our final destination.
Please take all your personal
belongings with you.", 
OB_TrainStop_Penky01,"Don't listen to him!
Panicking never solves anything!  We need to clear the tracks. If the
Sunset Express doesn't run, we can't
get to Starlight Cape.  If we can't get to Starlight Cape,
we'll never find the Big Paint Star!  If we don't find the Big Paint Star...̠

OB_Platform_KNP07_1,"I love trains. The very sight of a train
numbs the crushing emptiness I've
felt since I was but a wee spore.", 
OB_Boss_LAR02,"You grill a mean steak, Mario.  You should have been a chef! 
At least that way, you would've had
a nice long culinary existence.  But instead, I'm gonna cook you up
a tuna-fist sandwich before we get
to Starlight Cape!  Lord Bowser is expecting the
Big Paint Star, and I have no
intention of disappointing him.  Have you ever seen his disappointed
face? It's heartbreaking!  Enough small talk.
Let's get this over with.", 
OB_Arrival_EKNP00,"We've arrived at Starlight Cape!
You must be tired after the long trip!", 
OB_Platform_KNP07_2,"That's right! I used the water tower
to get up to that ledge!", 
OB_RedRescue36_01,"It's hard not to move a single muscle.
What if your eyes get dry?", 
OB_Boss_LAR03,"The Sunset Express and the Big Paint
Star both belong to me! But if you're
really itching to see that Game Over
screen, come at me!", 
OB_Arrival_EKNP01,"The engine is now in working order!
I'm so glad! Let's take another trip
together sometime, OK?", 
OB_Platform_KNP07_3,"It may be the last journey for that
engine, but it can still go pretty fast!
Seems to still be in working order.", 
OB_RedRescue36_02,"We are red Rescue Squad members
36 to 39!", 
OB_Boss_LAR04,"WHAT...?!
No! This can't be...  I... I lost!  I can't ever face Lord Bowser again!
I'll have to go on the lam.̠
No, maybe I'll go on the lamb...  Lamb chops sound pretty good righ—", 
OB_Arrival_EKNP02,"The engine is running like a dream
today! No reckless speeding!", 
OB_Platform_KNP07_4,"I'm going to follow this train around
for the remainder of my miserable
life. I'm so happy!", 
OB_Arrival_EKNP03,"Whew, we made it!
It got a little dicey there,
but I had fun!  So, there should be a Big Paint Star
around here somewhere... Let's see
what we can find!", 
OB_Platform_KNP07_5,"The best spot to watch trains
around here is that ledge up there.
It's too high for me to reach, though.  Which is weird, because I've gotten
up there before, but I can't for the
life of me remember how I did it!", 
OB_Battle_Boss_Sample,"Was that a Replica just now?
Tacky, Mario. I expected more.", 
OB_BOSS2nd_Penky,"Mario, do you have anything that
could keep smoke from coming out of
a smokestack?", 
OB_Platform_KNP05_1,"Mario, I know you want to hit this
Unfurl Block, but please clear the
rockslide first.", 
OB_Tram_EKNP01,"We caught up with the train! Please
hurry and stop that VIP, Mario!", 
OB_Platform_KNP05_2,"HOLD IT!
I know you want to smash my toes,
but go clear the rockslide first!", 
OB_PassingTrain_Painky01,"It's no good.
I don't think it can hear us.
Maybe it's sleeping.  Ooh! ǴIf we could find a way to make
my voice louder, I bet we could
startle it awake!", 
OB_Tram_EKNP02,"Please hurry and stop that VIP!", 
OB_RedRescue33_04c,"I think you'll have to sneak up on it.", 
OB_Platform_KNP05_3,"I hear you're running around all over
trying to find a way to wake the
sleeping rock.  Maybe this Unfurl Block will help!", 
OB_PassingTrain_Painky02,"Whoa, that was close!", 
OB_Tram_EKNP03,"If you ever want to go back to the
station, just come let me know.", 
OB_Platform_KNP05_4,"First a rockslide, and now the train
has been hijacked? It's just one
disaster after another!", 
OB_PassingTrain_KNP11,"Mario! Look at this humongous rock!  I've been firmly asking it to move out
of the way, but it won't listen to me.", 
OB_PassingTrain_Painky03,"Maybe you just need to be a little
more polite...", 
OB_Tram_EKNP04,"Go back to the station?  Ĭ
yesno", 
OB_Platform_KNP05_5,"Please travel with us again on the
Sunset Express!", 
OB_PassingTrain_KNP12,"Wow! Your incoherent screaming
woke that sleepyhead right up!
Thanks a bunch!  The Sunset Express can go on its
way now. I'll go tell the others!", 
OB_PassingTrain_KNP08_2,"I never thought the VIP could turn
out to be so rude!", 
OB_Tram_EKNP05,"Roger that! Back to the station!", 
OB_Stop_Painky01,"It doesn't seem like there's anything
if we keep walking this way.", 
OB_PassingTrain_Painky05,"I can't even rouse it by shouting as
loud as I can... If only I could make
my voice even louder!", 
OB_PassingTrain_KNP13,"The fence was broken, so I thought
I'd fix it up.", 
OB_Tram_EKNP06,"Well, OK, I guess we won't go back to
the station!", 
OB_Sunset_HEI01,"You've come all this way. Won't you
sit down and rest for a while?   Ĭ
yesno", 
OB_Sunset_HEI02,"Oh come now, no need to stand on
ceremony. Won't you sit down and
rest?   Ĭ
yesno", 
OB_Battle_Boss_KNP_01,"Wait!", 
OB_Battle_Boss_KNP_03,"This engine isn't yours to simply do
weird stuff with as you please!", 
OB_EnemyCoach_NOK01,"One day I'll settle down—maybe near
a pond—have a couple of kids, and
kiss this fool's life good-bye.", 
OB_Battle_Boss_KNP_04,"Owwwww...
Must...reach...the cabin...", 
OB_Shootingstar_Painky01,"Wow! Look at that, Mario! The
star-filled sky is just gorgeous!", 
OB_RedRescue42_01,"Seems like all these people have
their own troubles, you know?  Maybe you should take some time to
chat with them? Bad guys are
people too.", 
OB_Battle_Boss_KNP_06,"I'm going to the cabin to stop
that Shy Guy! Cover me!", 
OB_BackStation_EKNP01,"Hit the handcar's handle with
your hammer when you want to go!", 
OB_RedRescue42_02,"Later, nerds!", 
OB_Battle_Boss_KNP_07,"I-I'm not afraid!  Mario, please continue to cover me.", 
OB_Shootingstar_Painky03,"Ooh! A shooting star!", 
OB_Battle_Boss_KNP_08,"Just...Ĭone...Ĭstep farther!
I'm almost at the cabin!", 
OB_Shootingstar_Painky04,"Did you make a wish, Mario?  You probably wished for Princess
Peach to be safe, am I right?", 
OB_Platform_KNP03,"This entire car is reserved for the
red Rescue Squad.  The sooner we clear out that
rockslide, the sooner they can take
their well-deserved vacation.", 
OB_Battle_Boss_KNP_09,"Mario, I did it!
I chased the Shy Guy out of
the cabin!  Now go give Larry the ol' what for!", 
OB_Shootingstar_Painky05,"My wish was that we'd get all six
Big Paint Stars back, of course!", 
OB_BackStation_EKNP04,"Here we are! I'll wait for you here.  Hit the handcar's handle with
your hammer when you want to go!", 
OB_RedRescue02_01,"Careful, Mario! Don't let the Shy
Guys see you!", 
OB_RedRescue35_01,"Wait! Don't peel me off yet! Ĭ
First, allow me to introduce myself.", 
OB_Shootingstar_Painky06,"  There it is! The Big Paint Star!
My wish! My wish is coming true!", 
OB_RedRescue35_02,"All right! You can peel me off now.", 
OB_Shootingstar_Painky07,"I bet that the shooting star heard
my wish!  That means that your wish will also
come true, Mario!  Let's grab that Big Paint Star and
keep trucking on together!", 
OB_StationStaff2_KNP01,"The Sunset Express is pretty cool!  I hear a big shooting star came down
at Starlight Cape, right where the
train is heading.  The VIP who boarded at the
Tangerino Grill already has his eye
on it, though.", 
OB_Battle_Boss_10,"What are you all crumpled up for?!
Get yourself together!", 
OB_Platform_KNP07,"We can't depart until that rockslide
is clear.", 
OB_StationStaff2_KNP02,"When I told the VIP that Mario was
here, his blue hair stood on end!  He was like,", "I need to get to
Starlight Cape before Mario does!""", 
OB_Battle_Boss_11,"I haven't lost yet!", 
OB_StationStaff2_KNP03,"I'm so glad our beloved Sunset
Express is safe!", 
OB_Battle_Boss_12,"What are you doing?!
Open your eyes!", 
BB_RedRescue32_02,"We're red Rescue Squad members
3 to 32!", 
OB_Conductor_KNP01,"The red Rescue Squad is on a well-
deserved vacation, but I got a
feeling that won't last long...", 
OB_Battle_Boss_15,"Crush that dirty Toad!", 
OB_PassingTrain_KNP11_2,"I've been asking it to move, but it
seems to be sleeping.", 
OB_Battle_Boss_16,"Minions! Crush them!", 
OB_RedRescue33_01,"Thank you so much! Even us heroic

time to time!", 
OB_Battle_Boss_17,"Amateurs...",

character on the roof?", 
OB_RedRescue41_04,"Scrap...paper goes in the...
